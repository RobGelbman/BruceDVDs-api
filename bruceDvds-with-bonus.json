These takes do not include the introduction of Bruce by Max's owner Mickey Ruskin that is heard in the documentary about John Hammond called \"From Bessie Smith to Springsteen\". However the version of Growin' Up contains an additional 20 seconds of Bruce chatting at the conclusion of the song that was not featured in the documentary. The running time of this DVD is 10 minutes",

There is everything here from pro-shot footage, stage shot camcorder footage , TV chats show appearances, Awards shows, Benefit shows, political rally's, monument dedications and even a home wedding video !  \r\nThe quality varies as much as the content. Some of the earlier footage in particular comes from high generation sources and much of it is now available in better quality elsewhere. However, there are some real gems that you won't find on other DVDs. Highly recommended for the sheer thoroughness with which Bruce's career is covered.",

This has now been made redundant by the commercial release of the full show. Completists may be interested in the different camera angles compared to the official DVD. The 2003 Grammy Awards appearance is included as filler. The source appears to be a VHS recording for both broadcasts. This DVD can be largely ignored, since both the Barcelona and Grammy performances are available in better quality elsewhere.",

The audio is from a very good soundboard source. Some tracks are cut. It is entertaining stuff to watch, despite the fairly poor image quality. Highlights include the Nebraska set, especially \"Johnny Bye Bye\". \r\nAlso included on the same disc is 8mm colour footage from St Paul  on 19 Feb 77, filmed from the balcony at the side of the stage. Both image and sound are rather distant. However, it is still interesting to watch, since footage from this era is so rare.\r\n",

        "description": "Bruce followed up his live appearance on MTV/VH1 by treating an enthusiastic Italian crowd to one of the most interesting shows of the initial European leg of \"The Rising\" tour. Among the non-standard songs in the set list were \"Something in the Night\", \"You Can Look\" and a solo piano \"For You\". The first encore opened with the tour debut of \"Stand on It\" and Elliot Murphy made a guest appearance for \"Born to Run\". FedeUd has made an admirable effort to pull together four different video sources of the show. Two of these are shot from the right side of the arena, the other two from the left. The majority of the footage is stage shot, but there are also several looks at the giant screen included in the mix. The four-camera coverage provides tremendous potential, but the resulting mix is let down by the quality of the sources. All of the views are a little unsteady and none of them provide many real close-ups. Worse yet, the two left-side videos have been taken from VCDs and the image quality suffers badly from the high compression and low resolution of that format. The other two sources are much better, but still lack the sharpness of the best videos from the tour. The problems with the image quality are compounded by hit and miss synchronisation with the dubbed audio (unfortunately, more miss than hit). On the plus side, there are some high production values to be found here. The DVDs feature excellently designed menus, a nice photomontage intro and even a credit sequence. FedeUD has obviously put a great deal of effort into this one, but the poor image quality and synchronisation issues make it a hard-going viewing experience at times.",

        "description": "If ever there were a \"worthy\" candidate for an upgrade, this title was it. A fantastic performance by Bruce, but originally in less than stellar quality. And for years, that was the case. Not any more.  Miles Hai took it upon himself to attempt a serious upgrade to the picture quality of this historic footage. Using the \"Passic Night\" DVDs as source material he got to work. According to his information logs at the time of this set release, he 'painstakingly restored each camera angle shot individually, then peiced the whole thing back together'. Unhappy with the orginial audio, he also dubbed it with the superior sounding \"Piece De Resistance\" boot CD (to a fantastic effect). All told, the upgrade turn outto be a great success (you can compare the screenshots here to the previous version and see for yourself). It is not a pefect release however, as there are audio sync issues sprinkled here and then (difficult to sync audio with video that is garbled), in particular, on the final song of Disc 2 (Raise Your Hand)it is very noticable. The video is still flawed, but that is due to its source and not the upgrade. And even though the picture is greatly improved, it is difficult to make out detail or definition. Final word? This is the version to get. Its the best out there so far.",

The source for this is a 1st generation from the master VHS tape. It can be identified by the main menu - a picture of Bruce in a dark red shirt screaming into the mic, with the track names running diagonally down to the right of the screen.  Check the screen shots for pics.  There are a few obstructions.  It was filmed from Clarence's side of the stage.  Incredible close-ups.",

Features the complete, uncut 90 minute rain swept performance in New York as the main event - and the SNL Rehearsal footage is a great bonus as well. Only drawback is the camerawork quality of the VMA show; its pretty poor with cameras often filming the wrong person, and editing is clumsy. Still, its a must have for any DVD collection. Superb sound as well.  The audio was dubbed by \"DVD Dubbing Guy\" ",

        "description": "Brought to us by ScratchMonkey and the CTC, this set was held in the hands of the “ubers” until late 2006 when it was “leaked” to the wider community as part of TattooDad’s efforts. \r\nThis DVD is the same as the original release with two differences. Unlike the original production, the remixed edition does not contain bonus material of the Letterman and Conan 2002 TV appearances. But more importantly, it has also been perfectly dubbed from an excellent IEM source. It is a superbly authored DVD, almost professional in appearance, with introduction sequences and menus with audio. Two cameras are mixed together, one primarily filming the stage, the other focusing on the big screen. The camera filming the screen is used most often.  \r\nWhen the original production was released in 2003 it was a defining moment- it was one of the first, if not the first, multi-cam DVD for Bruce fans. Amazing progress has been made since then but this is the granddaddy of audience shot DVDs, the “Citizen Kane” if you like, and for that reason alone it deserves a place in any collection, particularly now it is available with awesome audio.\r\n",

        "description": "Bruce was really starting to mix up the set list on The Rising Tour by early 2003. The highlights in Jacksonville were \"Better Days\", \"Tougher Than the Rest\" and \"Let's Go, Let's Go, Let's Go\" (the latter as a tribute to Hank Ballard, who passed away the day before the show). This excellent footage from a single handheld DV camcorder was shot from the right side of the arena. For the most part, the image is exceptionally clear and reasonably steady. The filmer switches to the big screen for a few songs, but here the image is less clear and off-centre. Fortunately, the majority is stage shot. The camcorder audio is disappointingly distant, but still enjoyable. Overall, one of the best 2003 arena DVDs.",

Bruce is very much on his game in Providence.  \"War\" opens the show for only the second time, and several rarities make their first 2003 appearance -- \"Night,\" \"The Fuse,\" and \"Spirit in the Night.\" \"If I Should Fall Behind\" takes the solo piano slot. \r\n \r\nThe \"local special\" was a poignant one, as Springsteen and the E Street Band played one for the victims of The Station tragedy (on February 20, nearly 100 people died in a fire at the Rhode Island nightclub) -- \"Bobby Jean\" opened the encore, dedicated to those who died in the flames.\r\n \r\nSpirit In The Night is a definite highlight.  Excellent crowd as well. Picture quality is almost perfect, at times, the camera is a little shaky due to minor obstructions, but not significantly so.",

        "description": "\"A Spirit in the Night\" from ScrewDevil has been produced as a memorial to Matt, a fellow taper and friend of the filmers who was among the 99 people killed in the Rhode Island nightclub fire on 20 February 2003. Disc 1 starts with a montage of CNN news clips covering the tragedy. This fades into a scrolling dedication to Matt over the instrumental segment from \"Your Missing\". The Providence show itself (just 5 weeks after the fire) opens with a defiant rendition of \"War\". This isn't the only statement on the events unfolding in Iraq; an impassioned speech offers a full band \"Born in the USA\" as \"a prayer for peace\". Rarities making the set list include \"Spirit in the Night\" and a tender solo piano version of \"If I Should Fall Behind\". Bruce dedicates \"Bobby Jean\" (a song about lost friendship) to those that died in the flames. Patti was unable to make the show due to illness (Bruce jokes \"she's sick, sick of me\"), but she still gets an intro during \"Mary's Place\". This superb 2-cam mix uses the previously circulated stage-shot video from the right of the arena together with a new source from left centre. Picture quality from both cameras is uniformly excellent and a great audience tape has been used to dub the audio. The images are slightly unsteady at times, but the filmers do a good job of following the action on stage. One or both cameras occasionally switch to the screen, particularly when Bruce is at the piano. There is some use of black & white (\"Night\") and/or a low frame rate (e.g. \"Countin on a Miracle\") for special effect. \"Into the Fire\" is mixed with amateur footage of the nightclub fire for astonishingly moving results. Also included on the discs are a VH1 Special on the Rhode Island fire and similar events in rock history (\"Terror in the Front Row\") and more CNN clips covering the inquiry into the tragedy (including interviews with members of Great White and Kiss). This DVD collection is as a great record of a standout show and a fitting tribute to Matt. This is some of ScrewDevil's best work. A definite \"must-have\".",

        "description": "By the time the \"Rising\" tour hit Rochester, Bruce was really starting to mix up the set list. This terrific show was full of surprises, with \"No Surrender\" as the opener, \"Blinded By the Light\" and \"Nothing Man\" in the main set and \"Fire\" by request in the encores. Patti Scialfa was out sick for the second night in a row (so Bruce smooches with her mike stand instead during \"Mary's Place\"). The superb \"Blue Cross Boss\" from Cheesesteak Productions takes the previously circulated video of the show as its source. The majority is stage shot, although it switches to the screen for \"Empty Sky\" and most of the final encore. The most striking thing about the footage is the location of the filmer. He/she is at the back of the arena and so is able to get a great head-on shot of the stage. The zoom is used for some good close-ups without any apparent loss of picture definition. In fact, the image is razor sharp with great colour balance. The show is nicely filmed from a tripod with steady pans to the appropriate band members during their solos. There is a regular stream of bodies passing across the field of view, but they appear as a brief flicker and are only a minor distraction. The audio, while not outstanding, is good enough to compliment the superb video. Most importantly, there are no synchronisation problems like those present on the previous dubbed version. Disc 2 starts with a nice slide show of still pictures of the city and the band over the intro to \"Backstreets\" (there is no image on the source video at this point). Hidden away as a Bonus Feature at the end of Disc 2 are four and a half minutes of multi-cam pro shot footage from the beginning of the show. We get the band's stage entrance, together with incomplete clips of \"The Rising\" and \"Lonesome Day\". This was presumably filmed for local TV news coverage and quality is close to perfect. The disc menus stay with the \"Blue Cross\" theme, with the Song Selection sub-menus cleverly mimicking a medical bill. Artwork isn't normally discussed here, but an exception is required in this case. The DVD cover design by Gchord is simply stunning. If you have the previous DVD from the show then this is definitely a worthwhile upgrade. If you don't, then this should be high on your \"Wants\" list.",

It is slightly better than the footage from the previous night, with very little in the way of interference this time. There are some brief cuts during a couple of the songs. This is the same source tape as the 2 disc version. However, the XP transfer across 3 discs results in a slightly sharper image. Despite the relatively poor image quality, this is Bruce's at his finest and so this DVD is essential viewing.",

        "description": "The Rising Tour's stop in Tampa brought a shake-up to the set-list, with the inclusion of nine song that were not performed the previous night in Miami. It was a show full of highlights for fans of the early material, including a pairing of tracks from the first album (\"Does This Bus Stop...\" and \"...Saint in the City\"), a solo piano \"Incident...\" and a raucous \"Twist and Shout\" as the closer. Excellent quality audio and video of the performance has been available for some time, but they had only circulated separately. That situation is now remedied with the superb \"Meltdown at the Ice Palace\" (a ScrewDevil Production of a Mad Raving Stark film). The video consists of the same two camera angles as previously seen, but ScrewDevil has gone back to the master tapes to create a brand new mix. The very start of the show was not filmed, so a photomontage accompanies the opening strains of \"The Rising\". Only one camera source is then used for the first half of the first set (excluding \"The Ties That Bind\", which is cut entirely). The view comes from just left of centre at the back of the arena and the picture quality is outstanding. Despite the need to use full zoom, the image is razor shape. There is a natural colour balance and solid black tones. The camera work is slightly unsteady at times, with a few brief obstructions and the occasional off-stage shot. For most of the time though, we get a great view of the band. Some portions are shot from the screen and it takes the filmer a few moments to centre the image when he makes the switch. Once settled, the quality of the screen shots is very good. The second video source kicks in during \"World's Apart\". This view is from high on the left side of the arena, just behind Bruce. The autofocus occasionally locks onto the lighting rig instead of the stage, but otherwise the picture quality is equally as good as the primary source. With two camera angles to choose from, some slick editing notches up the enjoyment factor even further. Even though the video quality is highly impressive, the real star is the phenomenal audio track. It comes from the 'jambo' remix of the IEM and audience recordings. The sound is bright, bold and dynamic, with an even mix and great separation. Another bonus is that the drop-outs which marred the \"Prodigal Son\" version have been virtually eliminated. The only negatives that could be found are the lack of crowd noise and some minor distortion on the lead vocal. The sound is a fantastic accomplishment for an amateur release. Sadly, both cameras missed most of \"Incident on 57th Street\". The original DVD substituted a clip of the song from earlier in the tour. Instead, ScrewDevil makes the wise decision to stick with the glorious Tampa audio, albeit with a blank screen until the last minute or so. It goes without saying that the DVD set comes complete with menus, song chapters and a title sequence. The combination of excellent video and superb audio puts \"Meltdown at the Ice Palace\" among the very best DVDs from the tour. It was well worth the wait. If you haven't done so already, go and seek out a copy now. Finally, the pedantic ones among you might like to note that show actually took place at \"The St. Petersburg Times Forum\" and not \"The Ice Palace\". The arena was renamed shortly before the concert took place.\r\n\r\n",

Gorgeous picture quality, one of the best from the tour, unfortunately the audio is as bad as the video is good.  The people around the filmer were a little enthusiastic - you can hear them singing.  If you want a good laugh at how most of us probably sound at a show get this DVD.  Otherwise get the dubbed audio version which is in NTSC format.\r\n  \r\nThe last arena show of the tour was a very strong show, with \"The Promised Land\" as an opener, the rare \"My Love Will Not Let You Down\" called as an audible, solo piano \"Incident\", and guest Allie Weinberg (Max's daughter) on keyboards during \"Ramrod.\"  Hungry Heart which opened the first encore is missing from the DVD.",

        "description": "Rehearsal footage shot in a private studio prior to the river tour. Exact date is unknown. Filmed with a single camera from front of stage. Most of the footage is a wide angle shot so there is a lack of detail but there are closeups during most songs. There are a couple of songs that are cut and a couple of songs that have multiple takes. The multiple takes feature the band working on arrangements and offers a glimpse of the band polishing material. Also of interest is The Ties that Bind which features Bruce playing the lead on a 12-string Rickenbacker.   Phoenix 7-8-1978 promotional footage is included as bonus material. This footage includes the version of Rosalita that was used for the video but includes the band introductions. Promised Land was also on the original promo reel but appears to be missing on this particular tape",

        "description": "When The Rising Tour rolled into Charlotte, the town was in the midst of blizzard conditions. However, Bruce warmed the crowd with an electrifying performance. Highlights of the set list included \"Backstreets\", \"Where the Bands Are\" and a seasonal \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\". The ironically titled \"In the Heat of the Night\" from SDonkey features a new transfer of the previously circulated video, direct from the masters. The footage is shot from high on the left side of the arena, level with the front of the stage. In several spots during the show, the filmer struggles to get a clear shot of Bruce between the audience members in front of him. When he does manage a good view, there are some excellent close-ups. The picture quality is generally very sharp, although there is a slight red shift in the colour balance. The audio has been expertly dubbed using a very good audience tape. The vocal stands out well and there is reasonable instrument separation. Also worthy of special mention is the title sequence. It uses a rotating cube of text effect, with video superimposed on the letters. Clever stuff. The side-on, partially obstructed view may be distracting for some viewers.  However, this is a quality production that deserves a place in your collection.",

There are some good stage shots and  the audio is dubbed from an above average audio boot.\r\n \r\nThe first three songs are missing so the DVD begins with Streets of Fire (One of only three times it was played on The Rising Tour).  Also the 2nd encore is taken from 7/27 due to \"technical difficulties.\"  The video from 7/27 is spectacular.  They are mostly stage shots, Bruce really was animated as it was the final night of the first stand at Giants Stadium.",

        "description": "This DVD is incomplete, however it contains all the songs you would want to have been filmed from this night.  Trapped, For You, Spirit in the Night, and Tougher Than the Rest.  It is filmed from the first level dead center stage.  The video quality is very clear and the audio used to dub the DVD is very good.  The downside of the DVD is that there are obstructions from the people in the crowd around the filmer and the video is very shaky at times but not to the point of being unwatchable.  During Rosie the obstructions are so bad the filmer shoots the people in the crowd dancing around them, which is very funny.\r\nEven with the obstructions this is a very good DVD from a Great show and a must have if you were there.

There are some obstructions throughout but nothing that makes the DVD \"unwatchable\"\r\n \r\nHighlights from the show are during Waiting on a Sunny Day when the lights went out onstage, making for a marathon version of the song. As the band kept playing, Bruce messed around with some flashlights and brought the crowd-participation bit back around three times until the lights finally came back on. Also a very fun version of Workin on the Highway.",

Also of note, The Fuse reappeared for the first time since the Europe.  The biggest highlight was for those people who knew the lucky girl from the first row Bruce pulled on stage to dance with at the end of Dancing in the Dark.\r\n \r\nMixture of Screen and Stage shot from the same cam.  Picture quaility is very good, some obstructions.  Audio is from an average to above average audio boot.\r\nThe first two songs The Rising and Lonesome Day are missing.",

        "description": "Saturday night at Giants Stadium caught quite a few folks off guard after what many felt was an average show two nights earlier.  Bruce raised the stakes and when the night was over had the crowd raising their hands in joy, gratitude, and disbelief.\r\n \r\nBruce and the band busted out of the gate with the ultra-rare \"Janey, Don't You Lose Heart,\" and that was just the begining other highlights included \"Trapped,\" \"Roll of the Dice,\" \"Because the Night,\" and the second appearance of \"Pretty Flamingo\" since 1978.\r\n \r\nEmmylou Harris joined Bruce for a poignant \"Across the Border,\" and the Philadelphia-based band Marah helped out on \"Raise Your Hand.\" This was a special night for many\r\n \r\nThis is THE DVD from this show to have. This DVD combines the screen shot video from the original version with a stage shot video.  An above average audio boot was used to dub the audio.\r\n \r\nThere is pixelation on each disc on both the screen and stage camera.  This is on the master tapes because the cameras was defective.",

        "description": "The ninth show of the ten night Rising Tour stand at Giants Stadium caught quite a few people off guard. Bruce raised the stakes and when the night was over had the crowd raising their hands in joy, gratitude, and disbelief. Bruce and the band opened with the ultra-rare \"Janey, Don't You Lose Heart,\" and that was just the beginning. Other highlights (and there were many) included \"Trapped,\" \"Roll of the Dice,\" \"Because the Night,\" and only the second appearance of \"Pretty Flamingo\" since 1978. Emmylou Harris joined Bruce for a poignant \"Across the Border\" and the Philadelphia-based band Marah helped out on \"Raise Your Hand.\" DVD Dubbing Guy has used the previously circulated screen shot as his video source. The handheld camera footage is extremely unsteady in the early going, but it gradually settles down until the filmer eventually manages to hold a reasonably tight view. The clarity of the image is exceptional, with great definition and true colours. The dubbed audio comes from an excellent audience recording and is a huge improvement over earlier versions of this video. This is by far the best version of the screen shot, but many people will prefer ScrewDevils's 2 cam mix.",

This DVD is from a 1st generation tape tranferred in XP mode for extra fidelity. There is some video interference but it is fairly minor. The audio for this DVD is from microphones that were located in the audience and suffers slightly from this fact. The audio is lacking the dynamic range of most pro-shot DVDs and there is a 60Hz hum that is especially discernable during the softer segments of songs.",

        "description": "Stockholm was treated to one of the best European shows in 2002. A terrific \"Gloria\" was the clear highlight, but the two-song solo piano spot with \"Incident\" and \"For You\" (both by request) was also outstanding. A rare \"Jackson Cage\" was another notable inclusion in the set list. \"This One's for You Buddy\" from SmackDonkey uses the previously circulated video of the show. It is shot from high on the right side of the arena, almost level with the stage. The solo piano portions are shot from the screen. Despite using a tripod, it is a little shaky at times, particularly when the filmer pans between band members or tries to avoid obstructions. The picture is very sharp and clear, although a narrow line of interference rolls down the screen occasionally during the second half of the show. However, what really sets this one apart from the rest is the outstanding dubbed audio. The sound is exceptionally clear, with great instrument separation and dynamic range. It is so good that this audience tape could almost be mistaken for a soundboard recording. The combination of great set list and sound quality make this one a \"must have\".",

The sounds of \"Cynthia\" hit the New Jersey air just after 8:30pm to make her live performance debut, and it made this show a real \"yeah, yeah, alright!!\" for diehards. Other standouts: \"Lucky Town\", \"Spirit in the Night\", \"Lost in the Flood\", and for the second night in a row \"Because the Night\" sizzled like a fried egg on a hot Texas street. Um, and that was before the encores. \"Kitty's Back\" kicked those off, only to be topped by the \"will-he-or-won't-he\" (he will!) appearance of Tom Waits' \"Jersey Girl\" to close things out.\r\n \r\nThe DVD is 98% screen shot with excellent picture quality and dubed with an above average audio boot from the show.",

A second Cam films both the stage and screen and has very good picture quality.  The 3rd cam is the screen shot DVD that surfaced shortly after the show.  Three songs are in black and white; Into the Fire, No Surrender & Glory Days.  The audio is dubbed with an above average audio boot.\r\n\r\nThe DVD has a very cool introduction with pictures from the parking lot before the show.  This is the DVD to get from this night.",

        "description": "Ludwigshafen was the second stop on the European stadium leg of \"The Rising\" tour. After nine months on the road, Bruce was really starting to shake up the set list. The German crowd was treated to a solo acoustic \"This Hard Land\" to open the show. Other highlights included \"Spirit in the Night\" and a full-band \"Racing in the Street\". Digi-TOx has used the previously circulated screen shot camcorder video of the show as his source. The image is very clear and sharp. However, the view of the giant screen only occupies about two-thirds of the frame. The various people and objects that are visible around the edge of the screen can be very distracting, although this problem improves when darkness falls during the encores. The footage is also very unsteady at times and there are frequent obstructions. \"Badlands\" is particularly bad, consisting almost entirely of a shot of someone's rear end. The audio has been dubbed using a very good audience recording and this certainly helps to make the DVD more enjoyable. The authored menus are also well-designed. Ultimately, the clear picture and dubbed audio can't overcome the obstructed view and the distractions around the edge of the screen. A good show, but there are several \"Rising\" screen shots that are much better than this one.",

        "description": "\"The Rising\" tour's return to Barcelona also saw Patti's return to the band for her first show of 2003 European leg. A relatively standard set list did feature the tour premier of \"Sherry Darling\" in response to a request from the crowd. Other highlights included \"Because the Night\" and \"Detroit Medley\". This remarkable video of the show was shot from the stadium field, directly in front of the right-hand big screen. It is reasonably steady, given the conditions under which it was filmed. Understandably, it does get a little more shaky towards the end of the show as the filmer tires from holding the camera. The most striking thing about the footage is the quality of the image, it is as sharp and clear as you are ever likely to get from an amateur screen shot. The obstructions are inevitable, but they add to the overall \"being there\" feel. The audio is very good for a camcorder source and there is none of the usual sync problems because of the proximity of the camera to the stage. The DVD has been authored using the master tape by \"brucevideos\", resulting in a very enjoyable production.",

Both were tour premieres, as were Rendezvous and Another Thin Line.  A wild setlist and powerful performance all around.  The encores opened with Janey Don't You Lose Heart followed by a rocking Pink Cadillac and ended with Twist & Shout.\r\n \r\nA great DVD from a great show. This is the DVD to get from this night.  It mixes a stage shot version with the screen shots from the screen shot version.  The Audio quality is also very good.  A Must have DVD from the tour ",

There are a few obstructions and the occasional loss of image all together, but overall the quality is impressive. The audio is a little thin, but good for a camcorder source.

This great footage is a mixture of stage and screen. It is very steady (with the aid of a tripod) and the picture is very sharp. There are a few obstructions and the occasional loss of image all together, but overall the quality is impressive. The best available audience recording of the complete show has been used to replace the original camcorder audio. The sound has better dynamic range, but the vocal is a bit hollow. The songs have been chaptered and new menus have been added, resulting in a nice overall production. A further upgrade of this DVD (\"Beyond the Palace\") has now been released. See separate review.",

        "description": "The first Rising Tour show at Crystal Palace featured \"Meeting Across The River/Jungleland\"™ and a storming \"Darlington County\". \"Seven Nights To Rock\" settled into the encores. \"Beyond the Palace\" from July4th1985 uses the original 2 disc DVD as the video source. This great DV camcorder footage is a mixture of stage and screen. It is very steady (with the aid of a tripod) and the picture is very sharp. There are a few obstructions and the occasional loss of image all together, but overall the quality is impressive. The dubbed audience recording used on the earlier \"Move Over Prince Charles\" (also from July4th1985) has been enhanced by substituting nine of the songs with the excellent quality bonus tracks from Crystal Cat's \"Night After Night\" CD. The tracks featuring the Crystal Cat audio are indicated by \"(CC)\" on the setlist. The audio levels of the remaining songs have been boosted to minimise the difference between the two sources. The new menus are backed by a sample of the line from \"Born to Run\" that inspired the title of the DVD. Some people may prefer the consistent sound throughout the whole show that can be found on \"Move Over Prince Charles\". However, the improvement on the songs that use the Crystal Cat audio is considerable and so this DVD represents a nice upgrade. It is the best version we are going to get, unless the whole show ever emerges in CC quality.",

        "description": "This pro shot footage taken from the closed-circuit TV feed at the Capitol Centre, Landover (not Largo) on 15 August 1978 is probably the best known unofficial Springsteen video. The source tape for this colour footage is a couple of generations away from the master. As a result, the image is a little dark and murky. There are bands of interference running across the screen at times, but very little image noise. The soundboard audio is very good. This transfer to DVD (one of several in circulation) is across two discs with no extras. It is slightly inferior to the three disc XP version (which uses the same source tape).",

        "description": "\"Live on the Darkness on the Edge of Town\" from the Watchdog label features a newly unearthed source tape of the famous \"Largo 78\" pro-shot footage. This ~2nd generation copy is a major improvement in picture quality when compared to the previously circulated 3rd/4th generation versions. The washed out colours are replaced by more vivid tones and the rolling lines of interference are (mostly) absent. Whilst undeniably a great upgrade, this is still not the \"Holy Grail\" that some had hoped for. \"Jungleland\" is still cut and the tantalising clips from the show in documentaries such as \"Glory Days\" demonstrate that there is still plenty of room for further improvement. The bitrate is also rather low (the show is squeezed onto one and a half discs) and so an XP transfer of the same tape would probably be slightly better. The DVD also includes some truly fantastic extras. The Phoenix '78 footage will be familiar to most collectors and here it is presented from no less than four different source. The best of these (#1) appears to be from an original CBS promo tape with a razor-sharp image, but unfortunately a time stamp is superimposed on the bottom of the frame. The other sources are similar to what we've seen before, except for \"Promised Land\" which is in poor quality. Finally, the pro shot footage of Bruce's guest spot with Southside Johnny at the Agora Club, Cleveland in 1978 is also drawn from a stunningly good new source. The set is wrapped together with some fairly average menu designs. This currently represents the best version of this classic show.",

        "description": "A top-quality version of the infamous closed-circuit pro-shot footage from Landover (aka Largo) '78 is truly the Holy Grail of Bruce DVD collecting. We know how potentially great the quality can be from the brief clips seen in TV documentaries such as the BBC's \"Glory Days\". Whilst there has been a multitude of different versions circulated over the years, nothing has reached that ultimate goal. This latest DVD from \"jerseyboy\" is yet another contender for the crown of \"best yet\". The source tapes used here were apparently obtained from the late, great DJ and long-time Bruce-supporter Ed Sciaky. They are VHS dubs taken directly from the proprietary format \"U-matic\" masters, making the first time a 1st generation copy has emerged. The three tapes have each been transferred to separate discs in this triple set. It is immediately apparent that this represents an improvement on what has gone before. The colours are deeper, the blacks more solid and the definition sharper. Unfortunately, there are also some negative aspects. Small white lines flash in the image continuously, although it is unclear whether these are present on the source tapes or have been introduced during the transfer. The image is also considerably darker than earlier versions. There is also a noticeable dip in quality on the third disc. On balance though, the improvements outweigh these distractions and the net result is arguably the best version currently available. The discs are authored with a simple main menu, but no song selection sub menus. There are also a few brief spots of video interference on the source tapes that have been replaced by still images while the excellent audio continues interrupted. Disc 3 is padded out with some unrelated extras. These consist of a poor quality b&w tape of \"Quarter to Three\" from Passaic '77, a documentary on South Side Johnny that includes clips of Bruce (as previously seen on the \"This is Your Life\" collection) and four takes of the embarrassingly bad \"Dancing in the Dark\" promo video tests. It looks like the quest for the Bruce DVD collecting Holy Grail will have to continue, but jerseyboy's contribution does an excellent job of tiding us over while we wait.",

Also shows the filmer walking to and from the stadium. This DVD is completely screen shot with good cam audio, but not up to par with the other 2. \r\n Great show.  Many tour premiere's and special guests.  This show, in one version or another is a must have.",

There is a graphic at the beginning of each song with the name of the song. The concert is a very nice pro-shot film and this is a very good quality version. The filming has a lot of crowd shots and close ups of people in the audience - probably half the footage is of the audience! The parts that are of the band concentrate on Bruce so there ends up being little time left for the rest of the band. Paradise By The C and I'm a Coward are very spirited versions and Can't Help Falling in Love With You is a sentimental favorite with the audience waving sparklers.

        "description": "\"Half of the Show\" from Brucevideos showcases both new video and new audio sources of this well-known cine film. Unfortunately, as the name suggests, both are incomplete. The video is a little unsteady and distant, but this first generation copy is a major improvement. The colours are now more solid and the better definition reveals new detail. However, it cuts out after \"Thunder Road\", at which point the DVD reverts back to the previously circulated second generation video. As if the picture quality upgrade wasn't enough, the new dubbed audio is simply outstanding. This excellent audience recording is perhaps the best available from \"The River\" Tour. What's more, the DVD offers alternative streams of both the original master tape sound and a remastered version with extra \"punch\". The new audio cuts out after \"You Can Look\" and the remainder of the show is not present on the DVD at all, since there would have been no improvement over the previous release. The usual high standard of animated menus and intro sequence that we have come to expect from Brucevideos are present and correct. This version has transformed what was frankly a difficult viewing experience into a much more enjoyable DVD. Given the rarity of \"The River\" footage, this is a highly recommended upgrade.",

        "description": "\"Whole Lotta Rosie... Revisited\" is an upgrade of the well-known Toronto '84 pro-shot footage, as found on \"Whole Lotta Rosie\". Hence, it includes the re-edited and complete version of \"Rosalita\". On this new version, the \"Right Stuff\" logo that appeared for a few seconds at the beginning of each song has been digitally removed. Only the frames with the logo have been re-encoded, so the rest of the video remains in the same excellent quality as before. The other difference is the audio. This version features a remastered stereo track as well as newly created surround-sound Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS tracks. Unfortunately, the excellent extras on the original release have had to be dropped to make way for the enhanced sound. The new animated menus and intro sequence are very impressive and give the production an overall feel of quality. \"Whole Lotta Rosie... Revisited\" currently represents the best presentation of this superb film.\r\n\r\n",

The camera is very steady with very few obsturctions.  It is shot directly on the stage with lots of great close ups of Bruce and the band.\r\n \r\nA high energy show which included a great setlist opening with Don't Look Back.  The shows highlight was Incident on 57th Street played by request.  Other rarities included Rendezvous, a country acoustic version of No Surrender, and Jungleland.  Bruce and the band were all smiles throughout the night.  Bruce capped evening off with a 3rd encore rocking rendition of Ramrod that included a slide through Clarence's legs and a judo roll at the end of the song.\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "The pro shot footage of the complete \"Born in the USA\" show in Philadelphia is one of the most well known and widely circulated 'unofficial' Springsteen videos. The original source was apparently a VHS recording of a stadium sky box feed, but all versions to date have suffered heavily from interference on the image. This new version from the \"Watchdog\" label claims to be taken from a newly discovered low generation tape. The picture quality is undoubtedly cleaner than we have ever seen before, but there is still quite a bit of interference present. There is also a noticeable loss in picture detail compared to previous versions. This has led to the suspicion that this might just be the same generation that we have seen before, but cleaned up with digital filtering. Worse still, the sound quality is significantly poorer than earlier releases. The DVD also includes the previously circulated pro shot footage from Charlotte earlier the same year. It is a distant view from a single camera at the back of the arena. The low definition image and good soundboard audio are the same quality as we have seen on other versions. \"Live on the Born in the USA Tour\" version of the Philadelphia footage definitely looks different and can probably be considered an upgrade, but the feeling you are most likely to have after viewing this is disappointment that the quality is not better. It should be noted that this was released by \"Watchdog\" as a single pressed DVD9, but has been split across two DVD-Rs to make trading easier. This has resulted in the sub menus on Disc 2 listing the tracks from the whole set, but obviously only the second half can be selected.",

        "description": "This \"Old Grey Whistle Test\" TV special was originally shown by the BBC in the UK in 1986. However, the source tape used for this DVD is taken from a rebroadcast in Asian and comes complete with Chinese subtitles. The documentary features an interview with Bruce circa 1985 and a number of complete songs, although several of them are official videos. Of most interest are two performances from Philadelphia in 1984 (\"Born in the USA\" and \"Cover Me\"). A third track from Philadelphia '84 (\"Detroit Medley\") consists almost entirely of film of the audience ! What makes this DVD worth owning is not the OGWT documentary, but the extras. These include five complete pro-shot performances from the '85 tour. Both the main feature and the extras come from a 2nd/3rd generation source and the quality suffers accordingly.",

        "description": "This BBC documentary was first broadcast in 1987. It features a lengthy interview with Bruce as well as individual interviews with members of the band. What makes this special though, is the archive footage. Although some of it is well known (Hammersmith '75, Largo '78, Pheonix '78) it has never been seen in better quality than this. The real star, is footage from the last show of the BITUSA tour in LA in 1985. \"Johnny 99\" for instance, is simply stunning. If that wasn't enough, the extras are fantastic too. \"Thunder Road\" from LA '85 is seen in its entirety (part of it is seen during the documentary) and there are two different camera angles of \"Sandy\" from Hammersmith '75. The source for this DVD is a pristine off-air SVHS promo tape, resulting in a transfer as close to broadcast quality as we are ever likely to see.",

Filmer shoots mainly the stage, but switches to the screen once in a while.  Cam audio is pretty good, a little scratchy at times.  Excellent picture.  Periodically the filmer pans back and captures the stage and screen at the same time. Check out the screen shots for examples.  The is the Paris show to get!\r\n Rarities include \"Be True\" and \"Trapped.\"",

        "description": "Bruce's final German Reunion show showcased the tour premier of \"I'm On Fire\" in an otherwise standard set list. There was also a brief snippet of \"I Hear a Train\" sequenced into \"Light Of Day\" and Patti was given her moment to shine with a verse of \"Rumble Doll\" during \"Tenth Avenue...\". \"Bremen on Fire\" opens with a title sequence and photomontage over the audio of the start of the show. The video then kicks in around half way through the opener. It is shot from the left side of the stadium and the filmer does a good job of holding a steady, unobstructed view of a slightly distant Bruce. The image quality is clear, but a little soft due to some minor generation loss. There is a good colour balance at the beginning. However, once the daylight gives way to the spot lights, the picture appears a little over-exposed (particularly Bruce's white shirt). The shortcomings in the picture quality are more than compensated by the excellent audio that has been dubbed from the CD of the same name. The bright and strong sound is one of the best audience recordings of the tour. This is an enjoyable watch and a nice record of the European '99 stadium shows. ",

Also included are three songs from the second night, shot from a similar position. The image is dark, grainy and a little shaky. Audio is reasonably good for a camcorder source. However, these acoustic shows are a landmark in Bruce's career and so well worth adding to your collection.",

You can tell from putting the DVD in and seeing a poster advertising the show(see screen shot)at the begining.  \r\n Primarliy stage shot, although the filmer does move to the screen from time to time. Camera is aimed at the screen from \"My Love Will Not Let You Down\" through Waitin On A Sunny Day,\" unfortunately the camera is not straight(See Screen Shot).\r\n Very well shot though.  There are a few obstructions, but the camera is very steady otherwise.  There is a very slight audio delay, but the cam audio is very good.  Plus, with rarities like \"Tougher Than The Rest\" and \"Kitty's Back,\" you cant go wrong.\r\n",

        "description": "This marathon 58 track, 6 hour compilation documents Bruce's record breaking 15 night stand at the Meadowlands which kicked off the first US leg of the Reunion Tour. The highlights are too numerous to mention, with many songs performed seldom if ever again on the tour. Some of the more obscure selections from \"Tracks\" feature heavily. It is primarily stage shot, but there are a few screen shots along the way. There are obviously a variety of sources of differing quality, but sound and picture are generally extremely good. Although it is hard to tell for sure, most of the tracks appear to be dubbed. The puzzling question regarding this particular version is why it was created in the first place. The new menus are undeniable well designed, but the audio and video content appears to be identical to the earlier authored version. If you don't already have this set, then this version is the most attractively packaged one of the lot. However, if you already have the previous menued/chaptered version then there doesn't seem to be anything here that would justify an upgrade.",

This is a screen shot recording and the picture has been centered so that the whole TV screen is filled out. Unlike the \r\nMilano fixed screen shot DVD this DVD has full 4:3 picture and absolutely no black borders. \r\n The sound has been dubbed from an AWESOME remastered CD recording.  \r\nThe audio is amazing,  but there is nearly ZERO crowd noise which sometimes leads to a lack of atmosphere. So the author of this DVD decided to add another audio track with more crowd noise. You can easily change audio layers during any time while watching the DVD. The second audio layer is a mix of the CD and the original sound from the video.\r\n This one is a must have!",

        "description": "Philadelphia crowds always seem to get something special. The fifth night of the six night Reunion Tour stand was unique in many ways, not least because rescheduling caused by cancellation of an earlier show meant that this one now fell on the day after Bruce's 50th birthday. The showed opened by Bruce charmingly playing a fan-made birthday tribute song on a boom-box. He then proceeded by tearing into the topical \"Growing Up\". A host of other oldies were also scattered throughout the show, including \"Spirit...\", \"Does This Bus Stop...?\" and a rare \"Fever\". \"Birthday Night\" from Digi-TOx fits the previously circulated incomplete 2 DVD set onto a single disc. This unsteady footage is shot from the back of the arena, with the zoom unable to provide any real close-ups. The majority of the view is taken from the stage, but there are also several switches to the giant screen. The image is soft and suffers from colour saturation and a chromashift towards the blue. The camcorder audio is average at best. The video cuts out after \"Fever\", missing all of the encores and the \"Blinded by the Light\" finale. Digi-TOx has made a nice job of authoring this onto a single disc, but it is sad that the video of this amazing show isn't better.",

        "description": "This handheld camcorder footage from Bruce's legendary first ever Italian show has been in circulation in various formats for many years. Now, just in time for the 20th Anniversary, a new DVD sourced from a recently unearthed 1st generation VHS copy of the master has surfaced. The significant improvement in the picture quality is not enough to rescue Disc 1 (subtitled \"Day\"). The filmer shoots the stage from the stadium floor and struggles to get a clear view. In fact, you will learn far more about the haircuts and dress sense of Italians in the '80s than you will about the E Street Band's performance. The extremely shaky footage does capture the general ambience, but you are unlikely to be willing to sit through the short 29 minute running time. The DVD producers have chosen not to replace the distant camcorder audio because of the fragmented nature of the film (most songs are cut). The main attraction of this set is Disc 2 (subtitled \"Night\"). The filmer wisely changes his position and switches his view to the giant screen for the second set and the encores. He does a good job holding a steadier angle and there are far fewer obstructions. Allowing for the limitations in the technology of the day, picture quality is very good. All of the songs are complete and so the producers have been able to dub the audio. This fantastic stereo audience tape was recorded using two microphones mounted on poles either side of the stadium and is best known from its release on CD by Crystal Cat. Disc 2 of \"Milan 85... 20th Anniversary Edition\" is perhaps the best available audience shot DVD of the BITUSA tour. It is well worth the effort of tracking it down.",

DVD freezes after the China Club 2-12-1990, but you can skip through it to get to the Tradewinds footage.  Not a must have DVD, but gives you a great feel of the atmosphere in the small clubs.   Tracks 1-6 : The Stone Pony 8-15-1982 Tracks 7-8 : The Stone Pony 8-21-1987 w/Little Steven Tracks 9-10: The Stone Pony 8-22-1987 w/Levon Helm's All Stars Tracks 11-12: The Ritz 8-10-1987 w/Little Steven Tracks 13-14 : China Club 2-12-1990 Tracks 15-19 : Tradewinds 6-28-1993 w/Clarence Clemons and The Red Bank Rockers",

        "description": "Stockholm was the first city to get a look at \"The Other Band\" when it hosted the opening shows of the Human Touch/Lucky Town tour. \"Living Proof\" features the second of the two nights. The previously circulated DVD of the show has been used as the video source. It is shot from the right side of the arena, just forward of the stage. There are some nice close-up views, but it is very unsteady at times and there are frequent obstructions. There is also a strange telescopic effect when the zoom is used which occasionally masks the edges of the image. The picture quality is reasonably clean, but the video has been re-encoded and so there has been some slight degradation when compared to the original. A few still photographs have been interspersed throughout the video at some of the song transitions and other random moments. The main thing that \"Living Proof\" has to offer is the audio dubbed from Crystal Cat's CD of the same name. This good audience recording is a big improvement on the original camcorder sound, but synchronisation with the video is a little out at times. This is especially noticeable during the first song, which is unfortunate. The author has made a valiant effort to improve this stage shot video with upgraded audio. The interspersed stills are a novel touch. However, the obstructions and synchronisation issues become distracting after a while. It is also a pity that an authoring method that avoided re-encoding the video wasn't used.",

There is a \"crackle\" sound you can hear when you have the volume up.  When the volume is low, its not very noticeable, but clearly annoying when it's up.  The quality of the audio itself is very good. \r\n The bonus footage from Bayerischer HOF with The Hetti Schneider Band is very cool to see.  ",

The only downfall to this DVD is the generation.  The DVD is also one long track, so you cant skip during the show.\r\n DVD also features clips from a Spanish News Broadcast.  It includes clips of news, sound check, and pro shot concert footage.  \r\n Two disc version is the one to go with.",

        "description": "Out of the 2 versions known available, this is the one to have.  The camera source is the same as version 1(The same tracks are still cut (57 Channels and Nothin' On & My Beautiful Reward), but the better generation makes a big difference in this show.  The video was definitely edited by someone.  For instance, when a song is cut completely(which is often toward the end of the show), it fades to a white screen.  If a song is cut in the middle, and the filmer got more footage of the same song, it is continued right where he left off.  I know that is kind of a confusing description, but imagine it to be like if you kept hitting the record and stop button on your camera.  Any questions, just post a comment.  \r\n The video overall, shot from just a slight angle across the stage is very well shot.  The filmer zooms in and out just the right amount and pans across very well. \r\n The overall quality of this one is quite good, but for a average 92-93 fan it may not be necessary because of the song cuts.  A great one to add to your collection if you enjoy that tour though. ",

        "description": "The tenth of Bruce's eleven shows at the Meadowlands in 1992 saw a couple of interesting additions to the set list. \"For You\" and \"Racing in the Streets\" were performed for the first (and last) time on the Human Touch/Lucky Town Tour. The other main highlight was Southside Johnny's guest spot on \"All The Way Home\". \"For Love, Faith, Hope and Sex\" from \"SDonkey Productions\" presents a startlingly good quality tape of the show from LAM Videos. It is the same footage as the previously circulated DVD, but this time comes direct from the master.  The set opens with a brief title sequence dubbed with the spoken intro to \"Leap of Faith\", hence revealing the inspiration for the title. We then join the show at the start of the second song (\"Better Days\" is missing). The detail and colour balance of the image are instantly striking, given the immaturity of camcorder technology at the time. The dubbed audio is also remarkably good, due in no small part to the remastering done by Rockaway Rob. The footage is shot from an acute angle on the left side of the arena. The filmer holds the camera steady and does a good job of keeping Bruce centre-frame when he roams the stage. The view is mostly unobstructed, except for the final two songs when someone stands up in front of the camera. The great picture and sound quality and steady camera work makes \"For Love, Faith, Hope and Sex\" one of the very best HT/LT DVDs, the only negative aspect being the side-on view. Another terrific addition to the SDonkey catalogue.",

In Stan's words:\r\n This two-DVD set is all the raw footage from that night except for Leap of Faith which doesn't seem to exists anywhere (maybe the cameras were shut off for the two takes of it).\r\n  It includes all the stuff that was edited out of the official releases...  The six-minute crowd warm-up before Bruce comes out; Bruce's talking between songs (and he had a lot to say this night on a variety of subjects), and three songs (\"Book of Dreams,\" \"Souls of the Departed\" and \"Soul Driver\") that were never shown on MTV or on the later\r\nofficial releases of a VHS tape and Laserdisc of this show.\r\nPlus the final song, \"Glory Days\" is show in it's entirety. \r\n This has different camera shots that\r\nwere not on any of the official releases also.\r\n Thanks Stan!\r\n",

There are some good close-up shots when the filmer is able to hold a steady shot. This version uses an audience recording that first appeared on the \"Car Songs\" CD-R to replace the dull camcorder audio on the original. The sound is now clear and strong. Menus have been added using dramatic monotone images to complete a very good release. GOTJ shows have been neglected by the DVD dubbing community in the past, so this will be a welcome upgrade for fans of the tour.",

        "description": "A great deal of Bruce's music owes a debt to the writings of John Steinbeck. Bruce first drew on Steinbeck's themes of sympathy and justice for the working man on the \"Darkness\" album and this shared message culminated in an entire album's worth of songs about the struggles of migrant workers on \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\". It was therefore appropriate that Bruce accepted an invitation during the Joad tour to perform a benefit for San Jose State University's John Steinbeck Research Center. \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" from Ultimix uses the previously circulated video of the show. Like most of the amateur videos from the tour, this footage is fairly dark. However, unlike the rest, this one is very steady and the filmer was well situated in a central location. The picture quality is good, with reasonable definition and little sign of generation loss. The outstanding feature of this DVD is the excellent audience recording used to dub the audio. It is very clear and the strong vocal sound makes it possible to understand the lengthy spoken segments (another shortcoming on many of the other GOTJ DVDs). The DVD also includes a great title sequence that features a clip of Tom Joad's famous speech from the film version of Steinbeck's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (\"wherever there's a cop beating a guy, I'll be there\"). Ultimix should be commended for this quality production of an interesting show. Highly recommended.",

        "description": "A great deal of Bruce's music owes a debt to the writings of John Steinbeck. Bruce first drew on Steinbeck's themes of sympathy and justice for the working man on the \"Darkness...\" album and this shared message culminated in an entire album's worth of songs about the struggles of migrant workers on \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\". It was therefore appropriate that Bruce accepted an invitation during the Joad tour to perform a benefit for San Jose State University's John Steinbeck Research Center. The excellent presentation of the show on \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" from Ultimix has now been further improved by DVD Dubbing Guy. Most of the elements from the Ultimix version have wisely been retained, including the stylish menu designs and the supreme title sequence that uses Henry Fonda's soliloquy from \"The Grapes of Wrath\" to such great effect. Like most of the amateur videos from the tour, the footage is fairly dark. However, unlike the rest, this one is very steady and the filmer was well situated in a central location. The picture quality is good, with reasonable definition and little sign of generation loss. The dubbed audio on the original Ultimix version was already outstanding. However, DVD Dubbing Guy has replaced it with an even better source. The sound is vibrant, full and crystal clear. It rates as one of the very best audience recordings of the entire tour. The best video footage, best DVD production and best sound from the GOTJ tour have now all come together on the same set. \"Once Upon a Time in the West V2.0\" is undoubtedly an essential part of any respectable Bruce DVD collection.",

        "description": "The St. Louis TOL concert has been available for quite some time, but this more recently surfaced footage shows the performance from a quite different perspective. Amazingly, it is shot from the 4th or 5th row on the floor in front of the stage. Not surprisingly, it is very unsteady and there are constant obstructions. However, the filmer does an admirable job of keeping Bruce in view for as much time as possible. Picture quality (direct from the 8 mm master) is very good, but low resolution and a slightly overexposed image does mean that not much fine detail is visible. Audio is also very good, with no problems making out the spoken interludes. This video first circulated on two discs, but brucevideos has combined them onto a single disc without the need for any further compression. The source tape was missing the last four songs of the night. Floor shot footage from this close to the stage is extremely rare and gives a real \"being there\" feel. This is a great addition to the Bruce DVD catalogue.",

        "description": "This terrific multi-camera pro-shot footage of the Tunnel of Love Express Tour's stop in Turin originates from an Italian TV show called \"Notte Rock\". It begins with Bruce's stage entrance and then cuts to the final verse of the show opener, followed by around half of the second song (a rocking rendition of \"Boom Boom\"). The DVD then jumps to two consecutive performances from the final set of the show. The relatively low generation source tape has lost some of the picture definition, but is otherwise excellent viewing. The soundboard audio is strong. It is always great to have the opportunity to add new pro shot footage to your collection. The total running time is 13:45. Short, but sweet.",

Things don't start too well with a recording of the Letterman '93 appearance that suffers from ghosting. After that though, things improve dramatically with very low generation sources for most of the remaining clips. Highlights include the poignant Sinatra birthday tribute and the Rolling Stone special.",

        "description": "The source of this Silver Visions Production is probably the \"DVD Dubbing Guy\" version of \"Sony Studios\". The first version of \"Streets of Philadelphia\" is cut and \"Prove It All Night\" fades in. What has changed is that the on-screen counter is masked throughout by a black banner with the song titles in white text. If the \"DVD Dubbing Guy\" disc was the source rather than the same tape, it would have been necessary to re-encode the video to achieve this. In theory at least, there will be some degradation in quality. In practice, it is very difficult to detect any difference when the two versions are compared side-by-side. This version also boasts an alternate Dolby 5.1 mix, although this has been achieved by some digital trickery since the multi-track tapes were obviously not available to the producers. Purist will argue that the \"DVD Dubbing Guy\" version is the one to get. However, this version does a nice job of hiding the counter without any obvious loss in quality.",

This excellent pro-shot footage features the entire performance in front of a small crowd inside the cafe with a much larger crowd outside. The unique occasion and the song selection of some great rock standards make this a very enjoyable DVD. A 15 minute \"Making Of\" documentary is also included, featuring footage of Bruce in and around Berlin at the time of the video shoot. There is some picture quality degradation apparent, possibly due to using a (S)VCD as the source. However, it is still very good overall.",

A 15 minute \"Making Of\" documentary is also included, featuring footage of Bruce in and around Berlin at the time of the video shoot. This upgraded version uses a master copy of the \"Making of\" promo tape and a 1st generation copy of the concert as its sources. There is a noticeable improvement in picture quality when compared to the original, although it is still not perfect by any means. There is a \"Super Six\" logo in the bottom left corner of the screen throughout the show, but any distraction this causes is more than compensated by the cleaner image. The DVD even borrows the original's menu, although the text \"Version 2.0\" has been added. Collectors should take the time to seek out \"Version 2.0\" if they are adding \"Cafe Eckstein\" to their library for the first time. It is also a worthwhile upgrade for those who already have a copy of the first issue.",

The DVD opens with some unique amateur video of an impromptu performance of \"Thunder Road\" from the theatre balcony after his show in Naples, although the song is barely audible. Following that is some great quality pro-shot footage of 5 songs from the Frankfurt '96 show. The pro shot footage from Antwerp is sadly silent. Also included is some camcorder video of the Proposition 209 Rally in '96 from very close range. The remainder of the DVD consists of familiar US and European TV appearances. Reasonably low generation sources are used throughout. It should be noted that you really need to be a fan of the song \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\" to view this in one sitting. There are no less than six different renditions included.",

After briefly shooting the stage during the first song, the filmer settles on the screen for the remainder of the performance. Use of a tripod ensures that the image is rock steady. This \"Ultimix\" authored DVD uses a source tape suffering a bit from age and generation loss. The image is quite dark, but an excellent audience tape has been used to dub the audio.

The video appears to come from the same ~2nd gen source as the previously circulated standalone DVD, but the image has been cropped top and bottom to remove the lines of interference that marred the original. Depending on your point of view, this is either an improvement or degradation. The SOS Racism and Harry Chapin Tribute appearances are included as bonus material, but both are available in significantly better quality on other titles. The package is completed by a slick logo sequence (Frances Ford Coppola should sue) and attractively designed menus. Some might find the cropping of the interference removes a distraction, but purist will prefer the original version with the entire frame intact.",

        "description": "This 3 hour HBO TV Special from 1988 documents the entire 6 week Amnesty International Human Rights Now Tour. As well as on stage performances from each of the artists involved, footage from press conferences, backstage and in the streets of the various cities visited is also included. Bruce appears fleetingly on the first two discs, but his major contribution is around 45 minutes from his Buenos Aires set on Disc 3. Also included is the lengthy spoken intro to \"War\" from the Zimbabwe show. This XP transfer direct from a VHS recording of the original broadcast is close to perfect quality. Certainly far better than the single disc DVD of the Buenos Aires show.",

        "description": "Here we have two hour long documentaries from MTV, although they run nearer 50 minutes each since the ads have been edited out. \"Inside the Tunnel of Love\" (originally broadcast in 1988) features lengthy extracts of an interview backstage on the TOL Tour. Bruce is in a philosophical mood and offers some real insight into the writing and recording of the album. Interspersed with this are a variety of official promo videos and pro-shot live footage, the best of which is from Detroit in March 1988. Unfortunately, the official promos are mostly complete, while the clips from Detroit consist of only a verse or so, rather than the other way around. The whole thing is hosted by Kurt Loder outside various Asbury Park landmarks. It stands alongside \"Glory Days\" as the best of all Springsteen documentaries. \"Rockumentary\" from 1992 is a retrospective of Bruce's entire career up to that point. Most of the clips are familiar, with a couple of interesting exceptions. These include brief semi-pro footage of a performance at Max Weinberg's wedding (in very good quality), rehearsals in both LA and New York for the HT/LT Tour and pro-shot stage footage from New Jersey and Stockholm from the same tour. An excellent 1st generation source tape for the transfer to DVD has been used. The colours are a little pale, but the image is mostly sharp and free from any interference (apart from the last couple of minutes of \"Rockumentary\"). Overall, definitely one to add to your collection.",

        "description": "This DVD consists of three items from late '98/early '99. First up is Bruce's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 15 March 1999 at the Waldorf Astoria in New York. Bono's induction speech, Bruce's acceptance speech and the four songs performed with the band are all here. Next is some terrific pro-shot footage of \"Prove It All Night\" from the first Reunion Tour Rehearsal Show in Asbury Park on 18 March 1999. The source for this footage is probably a TV news crew. Finally, we have the 60 minute version of the BBC documentary \"Bruce Springsteen: A Secret History\", first broadcast in 1998. It contains an in-depth interview filmed earlier that year, together with a collection of now familiar clips from the archive. All three items come from very good low generation source tapes, although there is still some room for improvement in picture quality.",

        "description": "This remarkable footage from Hartford first circulated on a DVD that used a 2nd generation source tape. An improved version from a 1st generation source appeared later. FTD Productions have now provided us with a further upgrade by taking the 1st generation video and adding new menus and an intro sequence. The DVD opens with a slide show of professional photographs from the era to the accompaniment of the audio from \"Better Days\" (there are some problems with the camcorder at this point). The video then kicks in for \"Local Hero\" and is complete for the remainder of the show. The picture quality is very good, although there is some minor ghosting visible at times. What really sets this one apart from the rest is the fantastic quality of the camera work. It is filmed from a tripod left/centre of the stage. The image is rock steady and the filmer does a great job of panning to keep Bruce in the centre of the frame as he roams around the stage. Prudent use is also made of the zoom to pull back for the occasional wide angle shot.  The new menus and title sequence give the overall production a feeling of genuine quality. This is now the definitive version of this show and one of the best DVDs from the HT/LT Tour. A real winner.",

        "description": "The Regensburg show took place early in the Reunion Tour at a time when \"Tracks\" was still being featured regularly. The three songs from the box-set (particularly \"Rendezvous\") are the highlights of the set. This camcorder footage is filmed from the left side of the arena, almost level with the stage. It is very unsteady and the filmer struggles to hold a clear view of the band at times. However, there are some nice close-ups throughout the majority of the show. \"Wie Geht's Regensburg\" from brucevideos showcases a new video transfer, direct from the master tape. The quality is significantly improved from the previous version, with a cleaner image and slightly more balanced colours (although orange still dominates). Better yet is the audio. It is dubbed from a remarkable uncirculated tape that is one of the best audience recordings of the entire tour. The trademark brucevideos animated menus complete the package. This is a major upgrade that benefits greatly from the improved picture and sound. However, the shaky side-on view will still be distracting for the more casual collector.",

        "description": "The main feature on \"No Support at Earl's Court\" is the previously circulated 2 cam mix of the Reunion Tour's third night in London. The most noteworthy inclusion in the setlist is the first performance of \"Meeting Across The River\" for 20 years. Both cameras are handheld and in a similar position on the right side of the arena. One camera concentrates on a wide angle shot of the stage (with the occasional pan up to the screen) while the other sticks to close-ups of Bruce. Image quality from the first generation tape is reasonably good. However, Ultimix has improved things considerably by replacing the original audio with the great audience recording lifted from Crystal Cat's \"Earl's Court Night\" CD. The third disc in the set includes performances from the previous two nights, using the audio from the \"Earl's Court Night\" bonus cuts. Unfortunately, the video from both nights is from high generation sources. Also included as an extra special bonus is \"Racing In The Streets\" being soundchecked prior to the second show. The rarity value of this interesting footage outweighs the fairly low quality. Menus and an intro sequence complete a very nice package. Ultimix has done a very good job of producing a nice memento of the stand.",

        "description": "The Reunion Tour rolled into the Ft. Lauderdale area on 9 March 2000 for the first of two shows in the famed Spring Break destination. It also marked the third of a four show jaunt through the Sunshine State. The rarely heard \"Don't Look Back\" got things off to a spirited start, but the real surprise was the first performance of \"Brilliant Disguise\" since a European show almost a year earlier. Other highlights included the always-welcome \"Backstreets\". Among the pop-culture references that peppered the show, Bruce asks the crowd at one point \"Is that your final answer?\" The \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?\" catchphrase is not only used for the title of this remarkable debut release from BruceDVDs Productions, but the design scheme as well. Each disc features a motion clip of a different band member on the main menu. These transition to reveal a song selection menu that mimics the graphics from the quiz show. The intro sequence also uses a voice over in the style of a quiz show host to introduce each band member individually (featuring more of the animated figures). The video itself is the same 2-cam mix from LAM Videos that has already circulated on DVD. The filmers are each on opposite sides of the arena to give steady views with some good close-ups. BruceDVDs Productions has gone back to the master tape to create a new transfer that has been painstakingly adjusted with several minute edits to maintain synchronisation with the soundtrack. There has also been some colour correction to compensate for the occasional white-out on the source. The result is a clean and well-defined image from both camcorders. The primary audio is an excellent IEM/AUD mix that has been created by Rockaway Rob especially for this set. It is clear and lively, with great atmosphere. As a bonus, the unmixed IEM source is available as an alternative stream. Both tracks are uncompressed. Together with the maximum bit rate used to encode the video, this causes the set extends across four discs. The outstanding production values elevate \"Is That Your Final Answer?\" to arguably the very best presentation of a Reunion Tour show, if not any Bruce show. BruceDVDs Productions have set a new standard with their first release that will be a hard act to follow. Make sure you don't miss out on this one.",

        "description": "Brought to us by ScrewDevil Bruce Springsteen: Legends is a documentary originally broadcast on VH1 in 1998. It is a straight retelling of the Springsteen story from childhood to just prior to the Reunion Tour. It uses a wide variety of interviews, video clips and photographs from the archives, although most of the material will be familiar. The 60 Minutes segment originally aired in 1995, although a 2002 rebroadcast (complete with new introduction) appears here. Its consists of an in-depth interview with Ed Bradley, interspersed with the usual archive clips. Both shows are interesting and well made.

        "description": "Bruce accompanied the launch of \"The Rising\" album with an unprecedented blitz of US TV. Here we have every appearance from that period (August 2002 - February 2003). Highlights include VH1's extended version of the car ride around Asbury Park and the complete \"Nightline\" broadcast (including footage of tour rehearsals and an acoustic \"Empty Sky\" at Bruce's home). The original version of \"The Rising on TV\" (the very first release from the now-legendary ScrewDevil) used digital recordings for excellent audio and video quality. Nevertheless, DVD Dubbing Guy has searched through a multitude of alternative sources to improve the quality of some clips still further. What was previously near-perfect is now as close to perfect as we are every likely to see. The segments that have been changed are the Today Show performances (new video with better contrast, but audio dubbed from the original version), the MTV VMA appearance (improved 16:9 source), the Grammies appearance (new High Definition 16:9 video source, but dubbed audio from the original) and the \"Lonesome Day\" promo clip (new 16:9 source). The audio across both discs has been normalized for consistency and the problem with the menu audio volume has been fixed. The original menu structure and design has been retained, with the text \"v2.0 by DVD Dubbing Guy\" added for identification purposes. In addition to all of the clips from the original, there is an extra contemporary performance included as a bonus. It is a beautiful solo acoustic version of \"Thunder Road\" from the Lenny Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge dedication in October 2002. It is taken from a SVCD, but the quality is still very good and the audio has been remastered to reduce hiss. Owners of the original \"The Rising on TV\" are probably very happy with the quality, but perfectionists will find this a worthwhile upgrade.",

        "description": "This particular show (which there are 2 versions of) is a perfect example of how generation loss can affect quality.  The 1 disc version has blurry video and muffled audio.  This version is a whole different story.  It is at least 2 generations lower.\r\n The video is the same source as the first version.  The audio on this one is very good, not even comparable to the first.\r\n There is one thing that did catch my attention with the audio however:  On disc 2, before \"Because The Night\",you can slightly hear a click, which also seems to change the audio.  The next 2 songs (BTN and Brilliant Disguise)are way out of sync.  The audio quality is also not up to the same quality as previously during the show(but it is still better than Version 1).\r\n Of the 2 versions this one is no doubt the one to have.  The filmer did a great job of keeping the camera steady and getting a great variety of shots. It was also cool to see Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora play on \"Glory Days\" too.",

Camera is steady throughout.  Shot from the upper right side, it gives a different side angle, instead of the straight across the stage shots(that most of the 92-93 shows are).  Audio is also muffled on this one, similar to the previous night.  Where are the masters for this one?",

        "description": "\"12 Years Later He's Still The Boss\" from July4th1985 Productions takes the video from the previously circulated DVD and dubs it with audio from the bootleg CD of the same name. The footage is shot from high on the left side of the arena, but good use of the zoom provides some reasonable close-ups. It is evident that the camcorder is hand-held, but nevertheless the filmer does a terrific job of keeping the shot as steady as possible while following Bruce around the stage. Some minor generation less and colour saturation don't distract from what is otherwise very good picture quality and the sound is a significant improvement compared to the original camcorder source. The CD artwork has been borrowed to create new menus. This is an extremely enjoyable DVD and a \"must have\"for fans of the HT/LT Tour.",

You can tell because the standalone menu comes back after \"Roll Of The Dice\" on disc 1.  \r\n As for the show itself, it's a mix of stage and screen, both about half of the time.  Its shot from the left side of the screen, which means you dont see hardly any of Shane or Zack except the screen.  The screen shots appear very \"dark\", while the stage shots actually look pretty clear(even though the double blue standalone menu).  The audio isnt too bad either.

        "description": "\"Verona Night\" features the sole Italian show from the second European leg of the Human Touch/Lucky Town tour. The video is a new mix of two camcorder sources that have circulated previously on DVD. The camera on the right side of the arena shoots the stage exclusively. The image is reasonably sharp, but fairly distant. The image from the camera on the other side is also distant, softer and somewhat dark when it switches from stage to screen. Both are handheld and so a little unsteady. Despite the fact that title borrows Crystal Cat's naming convention, the audio is not dubbed from a CD. Instead, it comes from one of the camcorders and can only be described as below average at best. The author has done a good job of mixing the sources. The transitions are smooth and there is the occasional dabble with a \"screen-in-screen\" effect. Unfortunately, the video streams have been re-encoded and there is a noticeable degradation when compared to the originals. A nice effort, but the poor audio will hold you back from revisiting this one very often.",

        "description": "Released as part of TattooDad’s quest to liberate “ubertrader” material, this pro-shot DVD features the second-half of the show on a cold night in Verona. The first-half of the concert is not known to exist but intriguingly the discs are marked respectively as Act 2 and Act 3 so there is scope for this to become a 3 disc set in the future, although, as with a similar video from Toronto in 1984, we probably shouldn’t hold our collective breaths for Act 1! \r\nThis transitional period in Bruce’s career is much maligned by some fans but this performance showcases the “Other Band” after a year on the road and the DVD reveals a very competent musical outfit. The band could never hope to engender the same emotional connection with the fans as its E-Street equivalents but no-one in Verona that night would have thought anything other than they had seen a great show; the encore in particular is excellent with “My Beautiful Reward” and “ Workin’ On the Highway” being notable highlights, although the audio on the former is very slightly out of sync. Special mention too for a very nice acoustic version of  “Thunder Road”.  \r\nAs is the norm with HOJO, the production is of high quality and the Shakespearian theme is a nice touch. The video is excellent, particularly considering its age, and contains enough audience shots to ensure it doesn’t feel sterile. Unfortunately, the audio doesn’t quite reach the same standard. HOJO cleaned up the original audio to remove the hiss which marred the overall sound. It was then remixed with audience recordings to add a little atmosphere and try to overcome the distortion on the original source, presumably as a result of the audio level being set too high when it was recorded. The extent to which the distortion is still noticeable and will irritate may depend on viewers’ equipment or audio set-up; this reviewer found it difficult to listen to at certain moments on his PC but experienced no such problems when viewing the show through the magic of television.  Whatever the case, the finished mix is a significant improvement on the original source recording and audio collectors should note it has also been made available on CD. For the purists, the original soundtrack is available as optional audio on the DVD. \r\nThe bonus video features a performance from Oslo on the final night of the 1993 European tour. Featuring Rick LaPointe , aka roadie “Chainsaw, on guitar and lead vocals, it is, frankly, scary and shouldn’t be viewed by anyone with a weak heart- ever wanted to see Roy Bittan or Shayne Fontayne “headbanging”?! You may even be thankful next time Wolfgang Niedecken or Terrence Trent D’Arby shares the stage with Bruce!  \r\nWhether you care for the “Other Band” or not, this is a release you should hunt down.  What are you waiting for?! \r\n",

        "description": "This, \"self described\" basic one disc version, of an outstanding source, represents a small upgrade (if you will) compared to the HOJO release. First, the 'Lip-Sync\" problems has been addressed, to a nice degree. Second, a number of technical glitches have been fixed. Third, the audio (while mostly left untouched) is fixed to remove the more obvious flaws where possible. Top that off with it being on one disc, and you have the Brucevideos version of this fantastic release. It should be noted that the video and audio were not tinkered with, other than the improvements listed. The motion menu at the start was a nice touch as well. Either version you choose, this is one DVD you can not be without! ",

        "description": "The second show of Bruce's two night stand in Sheffield on the Human Touch/Lucky Town tour has been circulating on VHS and DVD for several years. However, 'MrCarlos' has gone to great lengths to track down the original 8 mm master tape. Spread over 3 disc for maximum bitrate, the show is now available in the best possible quality. The filmer apparently hid the camera up the sleeve of his coat and so it is hardly surprising that the footage is very shaky. The view from the seats on the right side of the arena is a little distant and there is minimal use of the zoom. It is mostly free from crowd obstructions, but the filmer occasionally points away from the stage. The main attraction here is the picture quality, which is amazingly crisp for a '93 camcorder video. This is marred only by the frequent struggles of the auto focus to hold lock. The audio is a little thin, but very good for a camcorder source. The package is authored with simple, but functional menus. The shaky view will put off the more casual collector, but MrCarlos should be congratulated for his efforts to bring the master tape into circulation. Purely from the perspective of image quality, there aren't many HT/LT shows better than this.",

The picture itself is very steady  the filmer zooms in on Bruce quite a bit, but also does a good job of getting wide shots of the stage.  The downfall to the picture is the gen loss, but it's not as big of a deal as some of the other shows.    The audio on this one is quite good considering the gen and its from the cam.  ",

There is also a \"white bar\" across the bottom left of the screen and a counter during the entire show.    \r\n  The audio is slightly muffled at times during the first disc, almost as if something was over the mic on the camera.  There are also some \"hissing\" sounds from time to time.  \r\n Included on this DVD is a Spanish TV news special from 1993.  Features a interview with Bruce as well as rehersal and live pro shot footage.  \r\n This is a show that needs an audio dub!",

        "description": "Shot from the front left side of the stadium, maybe 25 rows back.  Filmer does a pretty good job considering his surroundings.  Lots of obstructions from people around him and it is quite shaky..  The audio also has as slight muffle sound to it(although not as bad as other shows), along with a small \"hiss\".    Overall, its pretty cool to see the show from this angle, since there are not many out there from this tour this close to the stage.  Fans of the 92-93 tour should check this one out.  It's also funny to see Roy in sunglasses and a backwards hat!",

The camera is also pretty shaky at times, and being that close to the stage, there are many obstructions.  The audio itself isnt too bad though.  Many songs cut from the end of the show.\r\n The bonus footage on this DVD is some of, if not the best footage of the 92-93 tour.  The stage shots from this show and the performance of \"Lucky Town\", filmed for the \"Top Of The Pops\" T.V. show on 3-31-93 in Glasgow are incredible.\r\n  This one is worth having for the bonus footage alone.

If I had to guess, the filmer was holding the cam(maybe in the strap on his hand?) the whole time.  It is constant jittery up and down motions that make this one tough to sit through, which is unfortunate for the otherwise great quality and angle that the filmer had.  You can tell from the screen shots cause it was hard to get a still picture.  Although in comparisson to some of the others out there, beacause of the good audio, this is a good one to throw in when you are busy around the house.\r\n",

Another version from a 1st gen VHS is rumored to be out there.  The video is shaky at times, but its great to see Bruce back with his hometown boys.  The audio is also quite good, and does not seem to suffer much from the gen loss.  At the end of disc one, \"Glory Days\" from Letterman pops on, which looks to be like this show was originally recorded over something else.\r\n All in all, this is a show to have.  The concert was billed as \"A Concert To Fight Hunger\" in New Jersey.   The show features special guests Joe Ely, Little Steve, Clarence Clemons, The Miami Horns, and Southside Johnny. \r\n",

        "description": "\"A Concert to Fight Hunger\" was the first of two benefit shows that concluded the \"Human Touch/Lucky Town\" tour. There was a parade of guest stars, including Joe Ely, Little Steven, Clarence Clemons and Southside Johnny. Bruce took advantage of their presence by including a number of their own songs, together with covers of some standard oldies. \"Meadowlands Night\" uses the originally circulated DVD of the concert as the source of the video. The footage is shot from high on the left side of the arena and is a little shaky. However, the picture quality is reasonably sharp (despite originating from a 3rd generation VHS copy) and there is a natural colour balance. The major improvement here is the use of the excellent Crystal Cat audience recording to dub the audio. This is a big step up from the distant camcorder sound on previous version. Sadly, the video has been re-encoded as part of the authoring process, but a high bitrate has been used to minimise the loss in quality. Another unfortunate consequence of this authoring method is the bloating of the video across three discs. The greatly improved sound makes this a more enjoyable viewing experience than the original version. However, the results could have been even better, had an untouched rip of the more recently circulated 1st gen DVD been used as the video source.",

The intro and menus cleverly keep with the beer theme. The video is a 2 cam mix, presented in letterboxed widescreen. One camera films the stage from the right side of the park, while the other camera on the left of the park switches between stage and screen. Picture quality is excellent, although the image is a little dark. The footage from the camera on the right is a little distant and shaky at times. An excellent audience recording has been used to dub the audio. \"Local Hero\" from 6 days earlier in Detroit is included as an extra, complete with velvet paintings of a Doberman and Bruce Lee! This is probably not the best of the CTC releases, but the overall production still oozes quality. Everyone should add it to their collection.",

Over half  the run time consists of shots of members of the crew setting up the stage. This is interspersed with some brief clips from the show itself, including \"Glory Days\", the spoken intro to \"All That Heaven Will Allow\" and \"Twist and Shout\". The XP mode transfer comes from a 3rd or 4th generation tape and the picture quality suffers accordingly.  This one is certainly high on curiosity value, but will probably not get many repeat viewings.",

Its pretty tough to watch all of it, especially at the begining of disc 2 where there is a big \"hiss\" for the first few songs.  \r\nThis show is not widely circulated, and could seriously use an audio dub if the show is available on CD.",

This is the first copy out of 2 tries for us to get it to work.  \r\n The show is filmed from the right side of the stage, almost in line with it.  Shaky at times, but some great footage of one of the last nights the \"other\" band was together.  Features Joe Ely as well as other guests.  Bruce and Patti dancing together at the end of Brilliant Disguise is also pretty cool.  The audio is pretty good, slightly bass heavy.",

        "description": "The final Holiday Show in 2003, this was the longest and arguably the best of the three. \"Whatever You Want For Christmas, You Got It\" from \"Ruthless Copying Records\" uses the previously circulated video. The picture quality is crystal clear, although it is a little unsteady and there are a few obstructions at times. It is also fairly distant, although the filmer does use the zoom more during the second half. The two Victorious Gospel Choir songs at the start of the show and Steven's introduction that are missing from the source video have been replaced by still images. However, what makes this an outstanding upgrade is the superb dubbed audio borrowed from Crystal Cat's \"Christmas Soul Night\". The overall result is a much more enjoyable version of the show.",

Unfortunately, it is ruined by a partial obstruction, a continuous shuddering motion and a high generation tape source.

        "description": "The Main Attraction on this disc is two songs from Philadelphia in 1976 (don't be fooled by the mislabelled Menu). The source of this footage is actually a bit of a mystery. The proximity of the filmer to the stage, the excellent quality of the image (albeit a little dark and grainy) and the soundboard audio points towards a pro-shot. However, the unsteady camera movement gives it an amateur feel. The most popular theory is a TV news crew. This is by far the best footage in circulation from the Chicken Scratch Tour era and so should be included in any respectable Springsteen DVD collection. (NB: There is a \"Classic Rock Video\" logo on screen throughout, but it is not as intrusive as the infamous \"BLUE MOON\" logo on the Toronto '84 video). The remainder of the disc is padded out with the last 90 minutes of the 25 August 1992 Landover (aka Largo) show. The picture quality is relatively clear and sharp, but the view from the left of the arena is fairly distant. The audio is reasonable, given the camcorder source.",

        "description": "Most, if not all, of the TV appearances include on this set will be familiar to many Springsteen DVD collectors. However, the big difference is the outstanding quality throughout. All of these clips come from master recordings of the broadcasts to give superb audio and video reproduction. The highlight is undoubtedly the S.O.S. Racism footage which is far better than the versions previously circulated. This one alone makes it worthwhile getting hold of the discs. Many of the other clips are also much better than can be found elsewhere. All of the usual Letterman/Leno/Awards/Benefits/Tributes are here. Also included are all of the appearances from the '98 \"Tracks\" European promo tour. Pro-shot GOTJ footage from Youngstown and Madrid, as well as the two opening songs from the first US Reunion Tour show in NJ are added as \"Bonus Tracks\". One minor criticism, and it is a minor one, is that the clips are authored as separate Titles instead of Chapters. This means that the disc returns to the Main Menu after each clip. A \"Play All\" would have been nice. There are quite a few TV compilations around, but this is definitely the one to get. It is hard to imagine the quality could be any better on any future unofficial DVD releases of this material.",

        "description": "This remarkably candid footage was shot at the Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich on the night before a concert in the city. Bruce, Shane Fontayne and Sam Moore join the resident Hetti Schneider Band in the hotel ballroom at what appears to be a wedding reception. Impromptu renditions of \"Lucille\" and \"Twist and Shout\" follow. The filmer ( probably a party guest) struggles among the crowd on the dance floor to get a clear view. Consequently, the video is very shakey with many obstructions. The image is slightly out of focus and suffers from colour saturation, but the audio is reasonable for a camcorder source. On-screen captions and a narrow line of interference at the bottom of the frame are present throughout. The whole things runs for around 18 minutes. Curious stuff, but hardly essential.",

        "description": "This excellent compilation documents the two European legs of the HT/LT Tour. First up is a collection of single camera pro-shot clips from Spain in May 1993. It features mostly complete performances of \"Better Days\", \"Lucky Town\" and \"Born in the USA\" and video of Bruce arriving at an airport and a hotel. There is also a brief clip of a soundcheck, filmed from outside the stadium perimeter fence. The Italian TV Special from 1992 begins with the full extended record version of \"57 Channels\", accompanied by garish visuals depicting the era. An interview and complete pro-shot performances of \"Better Days\", \"Roll of the Dice\" and \"Born in the USA\" from the Italian shows follow. The footage from Ghent in March 1993 is perhaps the most interesting item. It includes pro-shot footage from the soundcheck (\"Lucky Town\" & \"I Aint Got No Home\"), an interview and pro-shot footage from the show (\"Better Days\", \"Lucky Town\", \"57 Channels\"). The 7 minute clip of \"Twist and Shout\" from the impromptu Munich Hotel appearance in May 1993 is from a different source than the separate DVD listed elsewhere. It is the only amateur camcorder footage on the DVD. Finally, we have the complete performance of \"Lucky Town\" from Glasgow in March 1993 that was filmed by the BBC for broadcast on \"Top of the Pops\". Tape sources are generally 1st or 2nd generation copies. Picture quality is consistently good. Pro-shot footage from 92/93 shows is relatively scarce, so this is a worthwhile addition to any collection.",

        "description": "Circulating amateur videos from the BITUSA Tour are generally fairly poor. The older camera technology and multiple analogue copying over the years often means that only low quality tapes are available. Unfortunately, this one is no exception. It is shot with a handheld camcorder from the right side of the stage. The angle of the filmer and the constant obstructions mean that only Bruce and Clarence are visible for the majority of the time. The zoom does allow a reasonably close view. The high generation tape source has resulted in poor picture definition, although the audio quality has survived reasonably well and is fairly clear. There is an occasional rapid flickering, particularly during low light levels (usually between songs). Some tape distortion is also evident. The transfer to DVD is a bit clumsy, with no menu and \"Bobby Jean\" split between the two discs (with the middle portion missing). The start of \"Atlantic City\" is slightly trimmed and the two songs performed between \"Cadillac Ranch\" and \"Pink Cadillac\" are cut altogether. The source tape ends before the final three songs of the night. Strangely, the author did take the trouble of setting the Chapters at the start of songs. For fans of the era, the DVD is still watchable. However, the more casual collector will want to give it a miss.",

        "description": "Like most of the amateur footage from the Born in the USA Tour, this DVD is in poor quality and incomplete. It contains the first set from the last show of the Japanese leg of the tour. Things don't start out too well. The filmer appears to be hiding the camera during \"Born in the USA\", hence the audio is muffled and there is no image. The sound improves slightly when the camera emerges to film the second song. The angle of the filmer to the stage and obstructions to his right means that only Bruce and Clarence are visible throughout. The picture shows relatively little generation loss, but it is badly overexposed. This is not helped by the white clothes worn by Bruce and Clarence, who often appear as little more than blurs. The audio starts to break up slightly during \"Darlington County\" and this gets progressively worse with audio loss of several seconds at a time during \"Prove It\", \"Glory Days\" and \"Thunder Road\". The camera angle starts to tip to one side during \"Atlantic City\" and ends up pointing at the upper level of the arena for the whole of \"Working on the Highway\". There are also some brief periods where horizontal lines of interference roll down the screen. The DVD has no Menu, but the Chapters are at the start of the songs. It is interesting to have the opportunity to see Bruce during one of his rare Far East shows, but only the most patient fan will be able to sit through this one in its entirety.",

        "description": "Like most of the BITUSA amateur camcorder footage, this DVD from the Tokyo stand of the tour is incomplete and in poor quality. Disc 1 contains most of the first show on 10 April 1985, minus the last song of the first set and the final three song encore. The first part of the DVD is very poor indeed. It is almost impossible to pick out the individual members of the band from the blur of light on the stage. Things improve slightly from \"The River\" onwards, when the filmer discovers the zoom control. However, the image is still unsteady and indistinct. The audio is reasonably clear and on a par with the better audience tapes from the tour. There are many cuts, with several songs missing starts or ends (or both, in the case of \"Downbound Train\"). Disc 2 contains five songs from the second set of the 11 April 1985 show. This time the filmer is in a more central location and uses a tripod, but the camera is tipped to one side. The audio is also rougher than the previous night. Also included on Disc 2 is a brief excerpt of an MTV Japan Special ironically titled \"One Night Stand\" (there were 5 shows in Tokyo). It contains pro shot footage of the first two minutes of \"Born in the USA\" from 10 April. Completist might want to add this one to their collection, if only for the rare pro-shot clip. However, casual collectors should avoid it.",

        "description": "\"Bruce Springsteen: A Secret History\" is a TV documentary that was first broadcast in the UK on the BBC in 1998. It contains an in-depth interview with Bruce that takes place in an Asbury Park bar and his home recording studio. This is interspersed with mostly familiar archive and promo clips. There is also an acoustic \"Born in the USA\", performed specially for the  documentary film crew. The source for this \"OJO Production\" is a master SVHS recording of the original airing. It is a significant improvement compared to the \"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame/Secret History\" disc, but there is still a small amount of picture grain evident. The aspect ratio is letterboxed widescreen. A worthwhile upgrade.",

        "description": "The design of this compilation of pro-shot footage suggests that it is a follow-up to the excellent \"The Boss in Europe 92/93\". In fact, some traders list the two discs as \"Pro Shot 92/93 Vol 1 & 2\". Unfortunately, the content and quality are significantly inferior. First up is the Red Bank Rehearsal footage, but the picture quality is much worse than the previously circulating DVD dedicated to this video. Like all of the clips here, the image is noisey, possibly due to compression loss from using a (S)VCD as the source.  Tagged onto the end is a short excerpt from a MTV news bulletin that uses footage from this performance and the interview that followed. The interview is also included here as a separate Title, but it is around 10 minutes shorter than the previously seen version. The video from Milton Keynes also suffers from the loss associated with a high generation or compressed source. The clip includes performances of \"Better Days\", \"Lucky Town\" and \"Atlantic City\" from the show on 22 May 1993 (it is wrongly dated as 22-6-93 on the Menu). By far the most interesting item here is the footage from Auburn Hills on 17 August 1992. It starts with a sound check that seems staged specifically for the TV news cameras that are present. After the last few lines of \"Lucky Town\" with the band, Bruce and Patti perform a beautifully laid back acoustic version of \"Across The Borderline\". Bruce then sits on the edge of the stage to be interviewed by the local reporters. Finally, we get the first three songs from the show that evening (\"Red Headed Woman\", \"Better Days\" and \"Local Hero\"). Once again though, the picture is fairly poor. This would be terrific stuff if it were in better quality. Overall, this one is worth picking up for the Auburn Hills footage alone, despite the fairly low picture quality.",

        "description": "There is relatively little footage in circulation of Bruce on the Amnesty Tour, so it is interesting to be able to see this complete video of his Oakland performance. The show features a rearranged \"Tunnel of Love\" and an acoustic \"I Ain't Got No Home\". Bruce should have been in a good mood as it was his birthday. The filmer is on the field, close to the front of the stage. Inevitably, the image is very shaky and there are constant obstructions from the crowd. The age of the source tape and the subsequent generation loss results in poor picture definition. The audio is reasonably clear. If you want to fill in a gap in you Bruce DVD collection, you might be interested in this one. It should be low on the priority list for everyone else.",

The many highlights of this tremendous show include \"Loose Ends\", \"Back in Your Arms Again\" and an ultra-rare performance of \"Mary Queen of Arkansas\". This excellent 2-cam mix is probably the best amateur video of the stand, if not the whole tour. Both sources are very steady and well filmed, although they are both at very similar angles to the stage. The audio is good considering that it comes from one of the camcorders, but a dubbed recording would have elevated this to one of the essentials. Also included on the second disc is the last part of the 3rd show in the stand. Again, it is a 2-cam mix, but this time one of the cameras shoots the screen. Audio and video quality are very similar to the main show.",

Like all of the Joad camcorder tapes, the image is quite dark. This makes the generation loss more evident against the black backgrounds. However, the filmer does a good job of keeping the handheld camera steady. The audio is fairly distant, but still reasonably clear. If you are not a fan of the GOTJ Tour, then this one will probably not convert you. For those that do have an appreciation for these solo acoustic performances, this is a worthy addition and better than many of the alternatives.",

However, the camera is mounted on a tripod and so it is much better than the handheld effort from the previous night. The steady camera work lifts this one above most of the other DVDs from the tour. The whole thing is expertly put together by SmackDonkey, but this will probably still only appeal to fans of Bruce's solo acoustic work.",

The show opened with \"Another Thin Line\" for the second time. \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-out\" includes \"My Girl\" and there is a taste of the Detroit Medley with \"C.C. Rider\" and \"Jenny Take a Ride\" in the middle of \"Light of Day.\" The show is superbly captured in this great 2-cam mix. One camera films the stage directly to the right side of Bruce, while the other camera does a good job of shooting the screen. Both cameras are on tripods and so very steady. Picture quality is very clear. A good audience recording has been used to dub the audio and the menus cheekily mimic the official LINYC DVD. There are a few audio and video glitches along the way, but nothing too serious. It's a tough call to choose between this and the following night for best amateur DVD of the stand. This one has the better audio, but the side view of the stage may detract for some people.",

        "description": "This was the first Garden show in 2000 without \"Code of Silence\", but another new song took its place - the world premiere of \"Another Thin Line\". Night Five also brought the tour debut of \"Secret Garden,\" plus rarities \"Something in the Night,\" \"Sherry Darling,\" and a full band \"Incident on 57th Street.\" Soozie Tyrell guested on two songs and Abby Weinberg joined in on keyboards for \"Ramrod.\" The show is captured by a single camcorder which shoots both the stage and screen. It is very steady, with a close view of the stage and a central shot of the screen. The picture quality (from a 1st generation tape) is very clear. The dubbed audio is a little distant, but a big improvement on the original sound from the cam. Disc 2 also includes the encores from 6/26 (although it is labelled as 6/12 on the Menu). It is the same 2 cam mix used for the DVD of the full show.",

After all the fuss over \"American Skin (41 Shots)\", Bruce started the show with a different new song, the world premiere of \"Code of Silence\". â€œAmerican Skin\" had its first NYC airing too and Bruce let the song speak for itself with no spoken introduction. An amazing set also included \"Be True,\" \"Roll of the Dice\" and for only the second time ever, \"Further On Up the Road\". The show is nicely captured in this excellent single camcorder footage. It is filmed from a tripod on the right side of the arena and is mostly very steady, although the camera does wander occasionally. The sharp picture quality is the best of all the MSG 2000 DVDs and the dubbed audio is also reasonabley good. The DVDs have been nicely authored by 'DVD Dubbing Guy'.",

        "description": "St. Louis was an extra long show, clocking in at 26 songs and over three hours. It also saw the return of Patti after a two show absence. Set list rarities included \"Rendezvous\", \"Brilliant Disguise\" and \"Spirit in the Night\". This DVD contains one of the best screen shots of the Reunion Tour. The filmer keeps the screen in the centre of the image with the help of a tripod. The picture quality is good, but does show some evidence of generation loss. The audio is also fairly good, considering it is sourced from the camcorder. Unfortunately, the DVD is incomplete. Disc 1 breaks up during \"Badlands\" and has been filled out by rewinding the source tape back to the beginning, repeating the show as far as \"Youngstown\". Disc 2 starts with \"Brilliant Disguise\" (missing out 3 songs) and cuts to the standalone DVD recorder blue screen after \"Spirit in the Night\" (missing out the final 6 songs). The overall result is that the parts of the show included could have fitted onto a single disc.",

Highlights of the relatively standard set list included \"My Hometown\" and \"Because the Night\". This excellent stage shot camcorder video is one of the best of the tour. It is filmed from the balcony on the right side of the arena using a tripod and is rock steady. There are occasional obstructions from the audience, but the view is clear most of the time. The picture quality is good, although there are some signs of generation loss. A good audience tape has been used to dub the audio. The only down side is that the camera zoom isn't very powerful and so there aren't any close-ups. The menus use a split screen with static song titles on the right while a clip from the video plays on the left.",

The difference is immediately obvious, with a much cleaner image and truer colours. The solid black tones are especially noticeable. This excellent stage footage is one of the best of the tour. It is shot from the balcony on the right side of the arena using a tripod and is very steady and well filmed. There are occasional obstructions from the audience, but the view is clear most of the time. As the title suggests, the dubbed audio is taken from what is commonly referred to as the ALD recording of the show (although it is possibly an IEM recording). Unfortunately, it is a very uneven mix. The piano dominates throughout and the vocal is swamped at times. The sax and guitars are also hard to distinguish. Many collectors don't like ALD/IEM recordings because of the lack of crowd noise and this one is no exception. However, it makes an interesting alternative to the sometimes average audience tapes that are usually used to dub DVDs. The set is rounded out with basic menus that borrow the artwork from the CD-R release. \"Live in Tacoma ALD\" offers a significant upgrade of the picture quality and an unusual alternative to the camcorder audio on the original. It is definitely a worthwhile acquisition.\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "The second night in Chicago on the Reunion Tour saw Bruce draw on the \"B\" set list. \"Don't Look Back\" opened a show which also included less frequently played songs like \"Trapped\" and \"Point Blank\". The clear highlight was a rare \"Something in the Night\". The DVD opens with some brief footage of a ticket stub. We then get video of the whole show, shot from slightly behind Bruce on the left side of the arena. The picture quality is clear and sharp, but fairly unsteady. The filmer struggles to maintain a clear view when the crowd stands up at the end of the first set and so switches to the screen, but it is not a good angle. The audio is rather distant and hollow, with some drop-outs at the very end of the first disc. Some of the quieter moments in the show (e.g. \"Point Blank\") are spoiled by a talkative audience member close to the filmer. Watchable stuff, but the more casual collector can skip this one.",

The filmer seems to be using a tripod, but the camera is still unsteady in the vertical plane. There are also some problems with the auto focus at times. What lifts this one above the rest is the good audio. The vocal, guitar and speaking parts are all very clear. The set list includes a rare performance of \"The New Timer\".

        "description": "This GOTJ show in Naples was one of the last of the tour. By this stage, Bruce was including more oldies in the set list and fewer tracks from the album. The subdued stage lights used for the tour means that most of the Joad DVDs are very dark. However, Bruce stands out from the black background better here than on most of the other videos. The footage is shot from a central location and there are few obstructions. The filmer seems to be using a tripod or other means to steady the camera, but the image is still unsteady at times. The picture quality is reasonably clear and the camcorder audio is better than average. The tape cuts out during the spoken intro to \"he Line\" and resumes half way through the point where Bruce leads the Italian crowd in a rendition of \"O Sole Mio\", hence missing three songs. The impromptu performance of \"Thunder Road\" from the theatre balcony after the show is included as an extra. This is one of the better Joad DVDs, but will still only be of interest to fans of the tour.",

It is shot from a camcorder on the left side of the arena, almost level with the stage. The image is clear and the colour balance is good. The audio is a little distant and muddy, but still perfectly listenable. What sets this apart from the rest of the bunch is the great camera work from by filmer. He/she does an excellent job of following the action on stage and good use is made of the zoom. There are a few obstructions and shaky sections along the way, but they don't cause too much of a distraction. Detractors from this period in Bruce's career will be forced to admit that this is enjoyable viewing. Steve Van Zandt even shows up for \"Glory Days\" to please the E Street Band die-hards. Note that a sequence of seven songs in the middle of the show (\"Roll Of The Dice\" through to \"Born In The USA\") that appear at the end of Disc 1 are repeated at the start of Disc 2.",

The crowd around the filmer is very active, many people jumping around and walking in front of him/her.  Therefore, the video on this one does have quite a few obstructions  The main reason for the 5 ranking is the audio.  It has no bass and is very scratchy, which makes it very difficult to sit through.      \r\n This one is for 92-93 fans only, unless you have an audio that you can dub it with.  Anyone???",

        "description": "Camera angle is interesting in this show from Detroit.  It start with the filmer on the right side of the stage, about a quarter the way back.  About halfway through, the camera cuts out, and picks up a few minutes laters on the other side of the stage.  A while later, the filmer ends up where he first started the show.  Not sure the story behind that.  \r\n As for the video itself, its shot very well.  The filmer has a hard time getting the close right hand side of the stage shots, due to people in the way.  \r\n At the start of disc 2, it seems that the audio is not the same as disc 1, does not sound as clear.\r\n Also included in this set are 13 songs from the previous night, 3-28-88.  Its shot from what seems to be almost the exact same area as 3-29-88.\r\n At the end of each disc, after the last song, there is a long period of just \"snow.\"  Looks like it was just left to record till the VHS tape ran out.  Disc 2 is around a total of 4 hours.\r\n Otherwise, apart from a few shaky periods, some obstructions and song cuts, its a good TOL show.  A lower generation with dubbed audio(whcih would be very tough to do) would make this one much better.\r\n  ",

        "description": "Excellent Tunnel Of Love show!  Shot from a very very unique angle, straight behind the horns at stage level.  \r\n The picture quality is very crisp and clear, and the angle alone provides a unique look at what goes on.  Just look at the screen shots for some examples(a very unique look at Bruce grabbing his next guitar up close).\r\n The only problem with the audio is on the \"loud\" songs.  You can hear a crackle in it, but its hardly a reason not to have this show. \r\n There is also bonus footage at the end of disc 2 featuring: The Alternate Tunnel Of Love promo video and\r\nMTV footage covering the opening show in Worcester.\r\n This is without a doubt one that should be added to your collection, especially if you were at this show toward the front of the stage.",

The clear highlight was a cover of \"Honky Tonk Woman\", which was worked into \"Darlington County\". This excellent camcorder footage captures the show extremely well. It is steady and well filmed with some good close-ups. The source tape looks like it is probably a 1st generation VHS copy, resulting in a good picture quality.

It was shot by \"Dublin Derek\" who does a great job of keeping Bruce in the centre of the frame, although a slight \"wobble\" is noticable at times. The picture quality is also very good, considering the low lighting levels at these shows. The source tape was transferred to DVD by Brucevideos. July4th1985 has replaced the original camcorder audio with an excellent audience recording. The vocal is clear and up-front, even during the quieter spoken segments. New menus have also been added. Many of the GOTJ DVDs are fairly poor, so it is great to finally have one that combines good quality video and audio. ",

        "description": "The year was 1986 and Bruce Springsteen was cruising at the top of the pop culture consciousness. In his wake was one of the best selling albums of all time and a string of hit singles. Even President Ronald Reagan had cited \"Born in the USA\" as the embodiment of American values (much to Bruce's annoyance). It had been a year since the triumphant conclusion of a record breaking world-wide tour and so anticipation was high for his return to the stage. However, the new army of fans who had jumped on the BITUSA bandwagon was in for a bit of a shock. Bruce's first live show after the tour (apart from a couple of unannounced Stone Pony guest spots) featured no pounding rock anthems with the all conquering E Street Band. Instead, he opened his set at Neil Young's all-acoustic Bridge Benefit with a stark accapella version of \"You Can Look, But You Better Not Touch\". What followed was a mixture of stripped down versions of recent hits and lesser know (and in some cases unreleased) songs. His only accompaniment was acoustic guitar and accordion. The results were stunning. A professional film crew was there to capture the events and \"Fire\" was later used as a promo clip (and can be found on the official Video Anthology). The footage of Bruce's complete performance has been in circulation for many years, but the high generation of the tape meant the quality was disappointing. All that has changed with the release of \"A Gift from Jakob's Dad' which uses a newly discovered 1st generation copy as its source. At last, the performance can now be done justice. Not only that, but we also finally get to see all of the other sets that night (Neil Young, Crosby/Stills/Nash & Young, Nils Lofgren, Don Henley, Tom Petty and Robin Williams). The show was spread across two tapes. The first was recorded in LP mode, while the second is in SP mode. It is actually the first tape that is in better quality, but both are showing their age. The cut between the two tapes is readily noticeable because there is an increase in noise on the image, a drop in colour definition and introduction of hiss on the audio. Unfortunately, this transition comes after the first song of Bruce's set. Despite these problems, it must be stressed that this still represents a significant upgrade from the previously circulated version. Ultimix has done a fine job of the authoring the DVD, including the well-designed menus, title sequence and bonus slide show of professional photos from both on and off stage. \"A Gift From Jakob's Dad\" is an instant classic. This footage can now take its rightful place along side Passaic 78, Largo 78/80 and Toronto '84 as one of the essential items in any self-respecting Springsteen DVD collection.

The sound on \"A Gift from Jakob's Dad\" is slightly muffled with a faint electronic hum present in the background. DVD Dubbing Guy has therefore kept the greatly improved video of Bruce's set, but replaced the audio with a dub of the Crystal Cat CD \"You Better Not Touch\". This audience recording is definitely cleaner than the original video feed, but the vocal is a little hollow and distant. Which one of the two is better is largely a matter of personal taste. If you found the interference on the \"A Gift from Jakob's Dad\" soundtrack distracting, then you will welcome this alternative version. An attractively designed new menu completes a worthwhile effort to further improve Ultimix's excellent release.",

The crowd was treated to a five-hour-plus show, with Bruce and the E Street Band rocking the proceedings to a close. It was an abridged version of their standard VFC set, including the collaborations with Stipe on \"Because the Night\", and Fogerty on \"Fortunate Son\". The documentary footage prior to the show included Bruce rehearsing with Fogerty and handwriting an early setlist that started with \"Devils and Dust\" (which was sadly not performed). This standalone DVD recording of the Sundance Network digital satellite feed began circulating just two days after the show. It contains the entire 6-hour broadcast squeezed onto a single disc. It is therefore hardly surprising that compression artefact are readily apparent. Despite this, it is surprisingly watchable. The picture is presented in non-anamorphic widescreen. For those that can't wait for the imminent arrival of superior versions, this is an adequate stopgap.",

The rebroadcast was missing Fogerty's \"Deja Vu...\", but the sound was much improved from the original screening. The quality is simply stunning. Not only is the image free of the compression artefacts that mar some other versions, it is also presented in glorious anamorphic widescreen. From a sheer technical perspective, this is just about as good it can possibly get. \"Vote For Change Washington... 16:9 The Rebroadcast\" is undoubtedly the best version of the performance available.

The night's events were broadcast live on the Sundance Channel and with digital recorders now commonplace, it is not surprising that there are a multitude of versions in circulation. However, there a couple of features that set this version from \"Owen35\" apart. Namely, the professional standard of the authoring and the wealth of material gathered together on a single dual-layer disc. Bruce's set is taken directly from the digital satellite re-broadcast and so it features the improved mix, when compared to the live showing. Unlike other versions, the Fogerty performance of \"Deja  Vu...\" that was deleted from the re-broadcast has been edited back in. The video has been zoomed to anamorphic widescreen and there is a choice of either a Dolby Digital or PCM soundtrack. The picture is a little dark and there is some minor blockiness in the backgrounds, but it is otherwise excellent. Also included are the pre-show and pre-Springsteen set documentaries, as well as REM's set. These retain their 4:3 aspect ratio in a 16:9 anamorphic widescreen frame. Picture quality is once again excellent, despite some minor compression artefacts. If that were not enough, the complete \"Nighline\" edition that featured the VFC tour and the Kerry Rally in Ohio are also included as 'Extras'. The whole thing is held together by an innovative and slick menu structure with animated transitions between sub-menus. \"Vote For Change\" doesn't necessarily offer the very best quality version of Bruce's performance (that honour probably goes to the \"DVD Dubbing Guy\" transfer), but it can't be beaten for variety of material or presentational style.",

        "description": "\"Summer's Here and the Time is Right\" brings Night Five of the fifteen night Reunion Tour stand in NJ to DVD for the first time. The highlights of a relatively standard setlist include \"Point Blank\", \"Racing In The Street\" and \"In Freehold\". This single camera footage is shot from a near head-on angle. The filmer concentrates mostly on the stage, but does switch to the screen from time to time. It is fairly unsteady, with occasional obstructions and a few periods with no image at all. Despite these imperfections, it is still very enjoyable stuff. A very good audience recording has been used to dub the audio and this also enhances the enjoyment factor considerably. \"My Love Will Not Let You Down\" was not captured by the filmer at all and so a slide show of contemporary photographs has been used to accompany the audio for this track. A nice intro sequence (using a \"vintage\" visual effect) and song selection menus in Bruce's handwriting complete a very nice package. This is another quality production from Ultimix.",

        "description": "\"People Have the Power\" was the first Vote For Change offering from the mighty production house of ScrewDevil/CTC (in association with NYC Shows). It is a tremendous multicam mix of the second show of the tour in Cleveland, Ohio (the State which proved to be pivotal in the Election). Although three different cameras are used, the footage from two of these angles was not available for the entire set. A rear view is only seen briefly at the beginning of the performance, while the excellent big screen view does not show up until the fourth song. All shots are extremely steady and unobstructed. The clarity of the video taken from the screen is excellent, while the main stage angle is a little soft and noisy (particularly in the dark tones). The combination of screen shots and stage close-ups give the illusion of pro-shot footage at times. The great video is complimented by superb audio dubbed from an IEM/audience mix which further enhances the professional feel of the production. Also included is Bruce's guest spot with REM. It is mixed from two angles to give a remarkable close-up view. Menus and the usual CTC intro sequence complete the package. This is just about as good as it get when it comes to camcorder DVDs.",

        "description": "\"Rockin Ass in Mineapolis\" from ScratchMonkey/CTC brings the Twin Cities VFC show to DVD in the form of an outstanding screen shot video. Giant plasma/LCD screens were used instead of the matrix types seen on previous Springsteen tours and the resulting clarity is amazing. There is none of the pixilation or glare from stage lights that normally affects screen shot videos. The contrast is a little low and there is a faint green hue. Nevertheless, the tripod-steady and dead centre image gives the illusion of pro-shot footage. There are even a few wide-angle shots from the arena cameramen to compliment the usual head-and-shoulders views. The dubbed audio comes from a very good audience recording. The performance is one of the best of the tour. Among many highlights, the stand-out has to be the supremely cool duet on \"All Along the Watchtower\" with Neil Young. Kudos should also go to ScratchMonkey for rescuing \"Rockin' in the Free World\" from a damaged tape. It should be noted that the first two and last two songs of the set are missing. Bonus clips of Bruce's guest spot with REM are also included. The package is held together with menus featuring a design in keeping with the \"ass\" theme and the transfer is 16:9 non-anamorphic widescreen. This is another clear winner from ScratchMonkey/CTC and quite possibly the best quality Bruce screen shot video period.",

The image has been reformatted to a 16:9 aspect ratio and encoded as anamorphic widescreen, meaning that it is no longer necessary to zoom in on the image on a widescreen TV. In addition, the original dubbed audio has been replaced using the audience recording that was released on CD by Crystal Cat. The improvements in sound are marginal and subject to personal preference. \"Rockin Ass in Mineapolis V2.0\" is an admirable effort to upgrade what was already an excellent release. The anamorphic widescreen is very nice, but the audio improvement is relatively small.",

        "description": "The final night of Springsteen's VFC tour brought a unique bill to the Meadowlands, with Patti Scialfa and her band opening this homecoming show and Jackson Browne replacing REM. Bruce played in the opening set with Patti, in the second set with Browne and one of the longest headlining sets of the run. Surprise guest Eddie Vedder joined the E Street Band for a powerful trio of \"No Surrender\", \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" and Pearl Jam's \"Better Man\". The encore opened with three classic CCR songs dueting with John Fogerty. However, the highlight of an emotional show had to be when Browne came out for \"Racing in the Street\". \"He's The Boss... I'm The Employee\" (a line spoken by Eddie Vedder during the show) is a terrific two cam mix. Both cameras shoot the stage at essentially the same head-on angle, but the filmers were apparently communicating and so the shots compliment each other nicely. The footage is combined with frequent transition effects, fades and split screens. Picture quality is excellent, although there is some image noise visible during the low light segments. The dubbed audio comes from a very strong audience recording. As well as Bruce's complete set, we also get his guest spots during the other performer's sets as bonus clips. Little Steven's duet with Jackson Browne on \"I Am a Patriot\" is also thrown in for good measure. The whole thing is authored with an intro sequence and menus. Once again, ScrewDevil has excelled with an essential release.",

The menus and chapters are kept  as they were on the original Screwdevil release.  The only way you can tell the differrence is the V2.0 on the main menu(see screen shot).  The bonus tracks have also been remastered, with the exception of \"Running On Empty\", as they were not part of the CC release.  \r\n Though dubbed from the CC release, the original dubbed audio was well remastered itself.  At times, the differences in the audio is hardly distinguishable.  The main standout of the CC version is when there is talking at the mic, its much clearer.  The bass is also slightly less distorted at times.  Either way, this show in one version or another is a must have.    \r\n",

        "description": "Orlando was the last of the originally announced run of Vote For Change shows and the significance of the venue (\"the scene of the crime\", as Bruce puts it) was not lost on the artists. Highlights included the tour premier of \"Prove It All Night\" and a duet with Tracy Chapman on \"My Hometown\". \"Always Bring a Spare\" is a very nice 3 cam mix of Bruce's entire set (but not his REM guest spots) filmed by Rabid Dog/NYC Bitch Committee and authored by ScrewDevil. Two of the cameras film the stage from a similar head-on angle, while the third capture the screen. Picture quality is generally very good, although there is a fair amount of noise on the image when full zoom is used. The shots are slightly unsteady and the screen isn't quite centred. Audio is good. This isn't quite as spectacular as the Cleveland or Minnesota VFC DVD, but is still tremendous stuff that shouldn't be missed.",

        "description": "The importance of Florida in the forthcoming Election was not lost on the artists in what was originally scheduled as the final show on the Vote For Change Tour. Bruce declared that he was \"glad to be in the Sunshine State... or as I call it, the Scene of the Crime\". Thus, the inspiration is drawn for the title of this alternative view of the Orlando VFC show from Rabid Dog/ScrewDevil Productions. Disc 1 opens with a shot of the stage from the back of the arena. The camerawork is very uncertain, but a different video source kicks in during the second song. This view quickly settles on the giant screen. Once locked on, the screen is held very steady and fills the frame entirely. This view is used for the vast majority of Bruce's set, with only a brief cut to the stage during John Fogerty's spot. This image quality is clean and sharp, although it is a little overexposed and colour shifted towards red. The dubbed audio is also very good, representing a noticeable improvement over the cam audio used on \"Always Bring a Spare\". Disc 2 contains the entire sets from both Tracey Chapman and REM, the highlight being Bruce's guest appearance on the latter's final two songs. Again, both sets are shot primarily from the screen (with the exception of \"Man on the Moon\"). The audio on the second disc has not been dubbed and is consequently a little distant. \"Scene of the Crime\" is an excellent example of how to produce a screen shot DVD. The steady full frame image and great dubbed audio make it enjoyable viewing. Don't try to choose between this and \"Always Bring a Spare\", just go ahead and get them both.",

        "description": "\"The Late Show\" was a BBC TV arts series that ran in the 1990's (as opposed to Letterman's US chat show). The edition dedicated to Bruce that is presented here was broadcast in the UK in June 1992, just after the start of the HT/LT Tour's European leg. The show opens with a clip of \"Local Hero\" from the tour opener in Stockholm. This is followed by a recap of Bruce's career up to that point, told through a series of comments by UK music critics and clips from the usual stock footage (Phoenix '78, No Nukes, LA '85, etc). The remaining two-thirds of the 40 minute running time contain an interview with journalist, presenter and long time fan David Hepworth in a LA rehearsal studio. Bruce talks about life, love, music and riots. This is interspersed with clips from contemporary promos, the SNL appearance and more from the Stockholm show. The real gem though, is a run-through of \"With Every Wish\" in the rehearsal studio (the audio on this clip is unfortunately from a boom mike rather than the soundboard). Also included on the DVD are two MTV News segments (one of which uses footage from the '93 Red Bank Rehearsals) and the live performance of \"Lucky Town\" from Glasgow '93 that was shown on the following night's \"Top of the Pops\" . The DVD has been produced by \"robertbobo\" from master VHS recordings of the original broadcasts. Audio and video quality is excellent, with negligible grain visible. The menu is also noteworthy for its attractive design. \"The Late Show\" is a nice companion to the other tour-related BBC documentaries (e.g. the \"OGWT Special\"). An excellent debut from \"robertbobo\".",

        "description": "This camcorder video captures Bruce's performance at the CNE Stadium in Toronto during the final stages of the BITUSA Tour. The footage is quite distant (with no zoom) and unsteady. Coupled with the low resolution of the 80's era camcorder, it is hard to discern much detail. Nevertheless, the 1st generation source tape gives a very clean image. The remastered audio makes the most of the limitations of the cam source. The usual high production values that we have come to expect from brucevideos are all here. The clean picture and reasonable audio makes this one of the better camcorder-sourced DVDs of the Tour. The fact that it is a complete show (rare for BITUSA videos) is also a bonus. However, it doesn't compare well to more modern video shoots.",

        "description": "SDonkey brings the Cincinnati show from the end of the US leg of the GOTJ Tour to DVD for the first time. This camcorder footage is reasonably steady, with some good close-up views. The picture is slightly overexposed, but at least this means that Bruce is not hidden in shadows like most of the other GOTJ videos. The picture quality suffers from a fair bit of noise in the black background and signs of occasional tape warp. However, SDonkey took great care to locate the best available source. It should be noted that the last two songs of the night were not filmed. The audio is good, despite originating from the cam. In fact, it is better than the audience tape that circulated on CD under the title of \"Cincinnati 96\". The discs are nicely authored with original menu designs and a suitably stark title sequence. Prior to loading the Disc 1 menu, we also get clever computer generated promos for SDonkey Productions and a certain Bruce DVD web site. A brief photomontage featuring shots of the venue is also thrown in for good measure. This is by no means the best of the GOTJ DVDs, but it is as good as we are likely to see for this particular show. GOTJ enthusiasts will be pleased to be able to add this one to their collection.",

The main highlights were \"Backstreets\", \"This Hard Land\" and Elliot Murphy's guest spot on \"Hungry Heart\". This reasonably good camcorder footage was filmed from the left side of the arena. It switches periodically between the stage and the screen, although there are frequent obstructions in both cases. It is fairly unsteady and the filmer often struggles to get a clear shot. In between the problem sections, there are some very nice close-up views. The image is clean and free from interference, but the focus is a bit soft and there is a colour shift towards the red. Remastering brings the best out of the camcorder soundtrack. The now-familiar brucevideos animated menus are all here. \"A Night in Paris... Vol 1\" is by no means one of the best 99/00 DVDs, but it is still an enjoyable watch.",

        "description": "\"Love Rushed Inside\" from brucevideos Productions features the second of the two Dublin shows during the HT/LT Tour. This camcorder footage is shot from the left side of the arena. The DVD transfer is direct from the VHS-C master tape, resulting in a clear and sharp picture. The viewing angle is mainly fixed, with minimal panning and no use of the zoom. However, Bruce remains centred in the frame most of the time. Some of the songs are partially cut (including the rarely performed \"Satan's Jewelled Crown\") and the second half of the show is missing entirely. Audio for all of Disc 1 and the first song on Disc 2 is dubbed from an excellent audience recording. The remainder of Disc 2 (four songs) is dubbed using the superb soundboard recording that saw the light of day on the \"Let's Play That Sun into the Ground\" CD. So far, so good, right ? Well, now for the bad news. The video is incredibly shakey. There is a continuous oscillation of the camera that makes viewing very hard work. Motion sickness sufferers are advised to pop a Dramamine pill before attempting to watch. As usual, the trademark brucevideos animated menus are used. A simple title sequence is accompanied by the third verse from \"Leap of Faith\", thus revealing the inspiration for the DVD title (and disappointing those who thought they had traded for a porn flick). There is also something of a hidden \"Easter Egg\" on Discs 1, which contains an alternative 4.1 surround sound mix (accessible via the \"Audio\" button on your remote). Any DVD that is dubbed with excellent audio is always going to be welcome. With a steadier camera and more overlap between the video and the soundboard, this would have been one of the best DVDs from the tour. As it is, most viewers will find it hard to watch more than a couple of songs in one sitting (although shaking your head from side to side in sync with the camera may help). Finally, a word of caution. If you decide to trade for this DVD, take care to ensure you get the brucevideos version and not the undubbed version that is also in circulation. Without the excellent audio, it has few redeeming features and should be avoided. ",

        "description": "Tacoma was just the eighth show of the Rising Tour and so the core set list was still bedding in. The Washington crowd were the first to hear the new rock reworking of \"Dancing in the Dark\" and the tour debut of \"Ramrod\". This single disc DVD contains a rock steady view of the giant screen, filling about two thirds of the frame. Image quality is very good, but there is a pronounced colour shift towards blue. A damaged segment of the screen results in a small white rectangle flickering on and off during the first few songs, but this is fairly unobtrusive. The audio is dubbed from an excellent IEM/audience mix that was uncirculated previous to this release. The audio/video synchronization is spot-on at the beginning of the show, but it drifts apart as things progress. The delay starts to become noticeable during \"You're Missing\", but resets after a cut which eliminates \"Badlands\" entirely. Unfortunately, the drift between audio and video builds up again significantly towards the end of the show. Circulation of this DVD was originally confined to \"ubertrader\" circles, but the version reviewed here is now widely available after being posted to usenet. Sadly, this is a standalone copy of the original authored disc. It has an auto-generated blue menu, with a non-functioning recorded image of the authored menu. The steady image and great sound makes this enjoyable viewing, at least during those tracks where the audio is in sync. Hopefully, the master version will eventually become available.",

        "description": "\"The Story of Bruce Springsteen\" is a 1986 documentary that was produced and broadcast by Dutch TV. It consists of a straightforward retelling of the Springsteen tale from his early days in New Jersey, through to the dizzy heights of the BITUSA world tour. The footage of Bruce himself will be familiar to most, drawing heavily on a couple of backstage interviews and the usual stock live performance footage (e.g. Phoenix '78, No Nukes). Most of the BITUSA promo videos are also included in part. There is however, a rare \"blink and you'll miss it\" clip that appears to show Bruce on stage in Rotterdam in 1985. Perhaps more interesting is the Dutch film crew's shots of Freehold and Asbury Park locales, together with a couple of interviews with pre-fame bandmates. There is even a somewhat bizarre segment where the infamous Ducky \"Wanna Buy a Duck\" Slattery sings \"Show Me the Way to Go Home\" while standing in a parking lot. There are burned-in Dutch subtitles during the interviews. The narration voice-over is also in Dutch, but new DVD player generated English subtitles have been created for this production (although some of these seem to have been truncated). The transfer and authoring represents the debut effort from \"Racing in the Street Productions\". Picture quality from the master VHS recording of the broadcast is very good, with only a little distortion on the audio. (Note also, there is a short audio drop-out around the 8 minute mark). The intro sequence, menu designs and chaptering are all very impressive. \"The Story of Bruce Springsteen\" is an interesting programme and a great first release from \"Racing in the Street Productions\". Hopefully, there is more where this one came from.",

        "description": "\"The Rarities Collection\" is a compilation of video clips, drawn primarily from TV broadcasts in the 90's. Most of the material is far from \"rare\", consisting of the usual award, chat and tribute show appearances that are well-known to most Springsteen DVD collectors. Thankfully though, these familiar clips are in generally excellent quality. There are actually quite a few gems here, although they are spread a bit thinly across the four discs. Perhaps the best of these is Bruce's five-song guest spot with Clarence at Tradewinds in '93. The picture quality is very good indeed, although it is unsurprisingly shaky and the audio is somewhat muffled. Also interesting are the three performances from the Tokyo GOTJ show in 1997. The rest of the truly rare clips are generally only a minute or so long each. These include various candid run-ins with TV camera crews, on stage at the Bottom Line in '92 and a Meadowlands soundcheck in '93. Also thrown in for good measure are three solo performances from E Street Band members on Letterman. The clips are in no particular order and some of them are strangely duplicated on multiple discs (albeit from different source tapes). There is only a standalone blue menu for navigation. All told, this an interesting and enjoyable collection with just enough rare footage to make it a worthwhile addition to any collection.",

        "description": "Bruce's first stop on the Kerry campaign trail was in Madison, Wisconsin. The somewhat rusty acoustic performance was broadcast live via the internet. Part of that webcast appears here in DVD format. Prior to the menu appearing, a clip that originally ran on the moveon.org website plays in full. It includes Bruce's \"Public Service Announcement\" and a very brief excerpt of \"People Have the Power\" from the Cleveland VFC show. The menu then loads and features a looping clip from the webcast dubbed with an acoustic \"Star Spangled Banner\". The webcast footage itself suffers from the low resolution, low frame rate and compression artefacts that you would expect from a video stream intended to play in a small window on a PC. Less excusable is the static and distortion on the audio that has been introduced somewhere in the capture, conversion or transfer process. Only Bruce's speech, \"No Surrender\" and Kerry's speech are included. The first song, \"The Promised Land\", is missing. It will only be the most ardent collectors who will be interested in this DVD, since the same footage taken from a TV broadcast (and hence in much better quality) is also in circulation. One to give a miss.",

        "description": "After Hurricane Ivan had swept through Western Pennsylvania in September 2004, local rocker Joe Grushecky decided to stage a benefit show for the victims of the devastation. \"Flood Aid 2004\" took place 3 months later in the opulent surroundings of Heinz Hall, home of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. There were a total of eight acts on the bill, headlined by Bruce and Grushecky with his House Rockers. Bruce's first performance of the night came during the set of fellow Jersey musicians Exit 105. He reprised his cover of Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\" from the VFC tour. No Neil Young this time, but it was still a terrific performance. Bruce strolled onto the stage later in the evening to perform a 3 song solo set consisting of \"If I Should Fall Behind\", \"Land of Hope and Dreams\" (in the same acoustic arrangement as its debut at the Clearwater Festival in 2001) and \"For You\" (dedicated to \"all the old fans\"). Bruce then welcomed Grushecky and his band on stage to join him for a set that drew on both their back catalogues, together with two songs that they had penned together. Highlights from a Bruce perspective were the Chuck Berry-esque \"From Small Things\", a rockabilly \"Johnny 99\" and a stripped down \"Factory\". The only nod to the Yuletide season came at the end of the show when all the evening's performers took the stage for \"Santa Clause is Coming to Town\". A unique night like this one deserved a special treatment on DVD and ScrewDevil comes through with a magnificent presentation. This remarkable camcorder footage from \"NYC Shows\" is shot from head-on in front of the stage. The image is crystal clear, very steady and offers some great close-ups. A second camera source crops up towards the end of the solo set with a slightly softer focus and some minor noise, but when it reappears later it is as sharp as the primary source. The colours are rich, natural and well-balanced. Although both cameras are at a virtually identical angle, they compliment each other well by allowing switches between tight-in and wide angle views. The shots are unobstructed throughout and it is mind-boggling to imagine how this was achieved in such a small venue without being challenged. The audio is dubbed from an excellent audience recording that benefits from the great acoustics of the theatre setting. The sound is full and clear, although the lead vocals appear slightly back in the mix at times. Audio/video synchronisation is spot on. The high production values we have come to expect from ScrewDevils are present and correct, even though this title was in circulation only a couple of weeks after the show. There is a nice into-sequence with a photomontage showing the flooding, together which text describing the background to the benefit. Menu deigns are simple, but effective and give access to the Exit 105 spot as a Bonus on Disc 2. \"Flood Aid 2004\" raised the bar on what could be achieved with a fan-made DVD. The image clarity and camera-work are as close to pro-shot quality as you could hope to get from camcorders. This one needs to be included in any \"best Bruce DVD ever\" discussion.",

        "description": "\"Visions of the Ghost of New York\" features Bruce's second of three shows at the Beacon Theatre in the eponymous city at the start of the GOTJ Tour. It is a Cheesesteak DVD Production in association with ScrewDevil Productions and Rockaway Rob of a NYC Bitch Film. The opening title sequence deserves a special mention all of its own. It is a hugely effective montage of morphing sepia-toned photographs overlaid with a flickering silent film effect. It sets just the right mood for the themes of the performance. The video kicks in shortly after the start of the first song. It is shot from high on the right side of the theatre. The filmer struggles to find a clear view and it is not until three songs in that the camera settles on Bruce. The image remains extremely steady for the majority of the show, but there are a few spots where the screen goes black. A few bodies briefly cross the field of view from time to time. The DVD transfer, direct from the master tape, has produced great results. It will be no surprise to those who already have a few GOTJ DVDs in their collection that the image is very dark. This is an unavoidable consequence of the subdued stage lighting. There is some noise visible in the black backgrounds, but the picture quality is significantly better than most of the other DVDs from the era. Definition is very good, with some nice colour balance during the better lit parts. The last song of the night (\"My Best Was Never Good Enough\") was missing from the source tape. The audio is dubbed using the \"Ghosts of New York\" CDR as the source, hence the DVD title. It is a strong sound, with no problem making out the spoken intros. The steady camera work, clear audio and high production values all go together to put \"Visions of the Ghost of New York\" among the very best of the GOTJ DVDs that are currently circulating.",

        "description": "\"No Surrender: Bruce Campaigns for Kerry\" is a comprehensive compilation of TV news footage from Bruce's appearances at the Kerry rallies in the days leading up to the November 2004 Presidential election. All four appearances followed a similar format, with a heartfelt speech on American political values sandwiched between acoustic performances of \"The Promised Land\" and \"No Surrender\". First up is the MSNBC coverage of the first rally in Madison, Wisconsin. The live broadcast of \"The Promised Land\" and Bruce's speech is included, together with two edited reports shown later in the day (including glimpses of \"No Surrender\"). This multicam video has been captured from a digital transmission for near perfect quality. Further coverage of the Madison rally in the form of raw TV camera footage is also included. This consists of a number of unedited shots from various camera angles. As well as clips from the two songs, we also get extensive shots of the crowd (one cameraman seems particularly fond of a young blonde in the front row) and video of Bruce visiting some student housing nearby. There is also a brief interview with Bruce as he boards his SUV after the show. Many of these clips are only a few seconds each and there is some repetition of the same scene from different angles, so the results are quite uneven. The bit rate is also very low, causing the image to pixilate at times. The sound comes from the camera mikes, rather than the soundboard and is hence a little muffled. Nevertheless, it makes for interesting viewing. The Columbus, Ohio rally is next, in the form of a single unedited camera angle. Again, the bit rate is a little low, leading to some minor pixilation. As well as Bruce's spot, we also see more of Kerry's speech. The Miami rally is also shown from a single unedited camera, but this time the quality is superb. The best of the bunch is probably the CSPAN coverage of the Cleveland rally on the eve of the election. Following Senator John Glenn's introduction, Bruce adds a third song (\"Thunder Road\") and gives a more lengthy and impassioned speech. Again, picture quality is near perfect. This excellent compilation stands as a testament to Bruce's strong beliefs regarding the state of the US in 2004. Some fans may not agree with his views, but everyone should make the effort to understand them in order to put his body of work as a whole in context. The relevance of material here has obviously dated badly due to the outcome of the election. Bruce's introduction of Kerry as \"the next President of the United States of America\", for instance, now rings hollow. However, this DVD plays an important role in telling the Bruce Springsteen story and so should be included in every collection.",

        "description": "There is very little video available from \"The River\" era, so this cine film from the ninth show of the tour is interesting viewing. Excerpts from six non-sequential songs are included. They are shot from the left side of the stage at an angle and distance reminiscent of the Montreal film from the following year. Unfortunately, the quality is significantly worse than Montreal, due largely to the high generation of the VHS source tape (apparently videoed from a projection onto a wall). The picture definition is poor and there is a large amount of colour bleeding. The audio, although muffled, has held up much better. Despite the poor quality, it is still enjoyable to be able to see early \"River\" performances. This version has now been superceded by a new transfer from the master reel.",

        "description": "This long-lost \"River\" footage surfaced recently as a high generation copy of a VHS video that had been shot from a projection of the Super 8 cine film onto a wall. The quality of that version was poor, but its release was successful in prompting the filmer to dig out the original reel. We now have a new transfer using the master as the source. The improvement is astounding. Gone is the colour bleeding that marred the first release. The image is now clean and sharp with more balanced and natural colours. We are still talking about film shot with primitive technology compared to today's standards, but this is as good as anyone could reasonably hope to expect. The steady footage is shot from the left side of the arena and consists of a series of incomplete clip from throughout the show. The audio is nice and clear. The rarity value, coupled with the surprisingly good quality, make this a definite \"must have\" for any serious Springsteen collector.",

        "description": "In March 1993, MTV took their cameras to the Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, New Jersey to capture some video that could be used in news bulletins announcing the HT/LT European Tour. The \"Red Bank Rehearsals\" DVD uses an original SVHS promo tape as the source of the transfer. The footage is divided into two parts. The first is a lengthy interview where Bruce talks about his new musical direction and touring without the E Street Band. Picture quality is excellent, but only the most dedicated fans will manage to sit through all 40 minutes. The second part is far more interesting. It consists of \"rehearsals\" (most likely staged especially for the cameras) for the benefit show later that night. Five songs are worked on, including the rarely performed \"Warm and Tender Love\" and \"Soul Driver\". The picture quality is clean and sharp, but the image is a little dark and the colour balance is shifted towards blue. \"Red Bank Rehearsals\" was one of the first releases from brucevideos Productions. The great quality of the pro-shot rehearsal footage makes it a \"must have\".",

        "description": "There is no doubt that this DVD contains a classic show from late in the \"River\" tour (there were only four further dates). Highlights of the set list include \"Jole Blon\" and \"Johnny, Bye, Bye\". Unfortunately, this record of the performance is in poor quality. The footage is shot from the right side of the stage and is a little unsteady with the occasional obstruction. The real killer though, is the generation loss. The picture definition has been heavily degraded and the colours have been washed out. In fact, the image is virtually black & white when the stage lights are down. The audio has survived a little better, but it is still distant and muffled. There is around 90 minutes of film here, with both the beginning and end of the show missing. Inexplicably, there is also a few minutes of the unrelated Munich hotel appearance from '93 tacked onto the end. The rare chance to see performances of \"Jole Blon\" and \"Johnny, Bye, Bye\" will be reason enough for some dedicated collectors to add this one to their library. Everyone else can safely pass.",

        "description": "The \"brucevideos\" version of this cine film from a classic show at the end of the \"River\" tour is sourced from a lower generation tape than the previously circulated DVD. It is shot from high on the right side of the arena and is fairly unsteady with frequent obstructions. Although there is a noticeable improvement in picture definition, this is still low quality stuff. The view is distant, the contrast is low and the colours verge on monochrome at times. Remastering has improved the audio, but it is still quite indistinct. Total running time is around 90 minutes. The DVD also contains eight minutes of bonus footage from the \"Darkness\" show in St Paul. Again, the view is distant and the picture definition is low. However, the image is much cleaner than the main feature. Hard-core fans will be thrilled at the chance to add this rare film of performances such as \"Jole Blon\" and \"Johnny, Bye, Bye\" to their collection. Nevertheless, despite the welcome improvements, this is still hard going to watch.",

It is a little unsteady, but the filmer does a reasonable job of keeping the screen in the centre of the frame and mostly avoiding the heads and arms of the crowd. The source of this transfer is obviously a high generation copy of the master tape and so there is significant degradation of the image quality. This results in dark and murky visuals. As usual, the audio has survived multiple copying better and remains fairly strong. Overall, this is a high generation source of an average screen shot video. Nevertheless, it is watchable enough. This shouldn't be high on your priority list, but it is worth getting hold of, if you get the chance.",

        "description": "Bruce performed six club shows with Joe Grushecky and The Houserockers in October 1995, presumably in preparation for returning to live performances before the Joad tour. The video on this DVD comes from the first of two nights at Nick's Fat City in Pittsburgh. The set list is drawn mostly from Grushecky's repertoire, but there a couple of Bruce's songs and a few rock/soul classics thrown in for good measure. The footage is shot from a high position on the left side of the club. The eagle's eye view avoids the crowd obstructions that mar most club videos, but the angle is a bit unfortunate for Joe and his developing bald spot. The filmer holds a reasonably steady shot throughout and the video quality is fairly clear, despite some signs of generation loss. The colour balance has shifted, giving the image a reddish/brown tint. Some black lines of interference creep into the image at around the half-way point and slowly get worse for the remainder of the running time. The high vantage point also appears to affect the quality of camcorder audio, resulting in a hollow and distant sound. The reasonably good video quality and unobstructed view make this one of the better club appearance videos, but it is a shame about the poor audio.",

        "description": "VH1's \"Storytellers\" is an occasion series that allows songwriters to perform their music and tell the stories behind the songs. Bruce used the opportunity to appear on the show to promote the release of \"Devils and Dust\". Bruce's performance in the intimate surroundings of Red Bank's Two River Theatre was by all accounts a very special evening. He was in turn charming, funny and interesting as he performed solo versions of 8 songs and then proceeded to break them down line by line. His explanations provided some fascinating insight, but were also as poetic and obtuse as the lyrics themselves at times. The show was cut down to just 43 minutes for its premier broadcast just 3 days before the album hit the shelves. The editing is frustrating, with the post-song descriptions overlaid and interspersed with the songs themselves. Some songs have verses cut and two weren't used at all. NeonKaiser's transfer to DVD was in circulation via the internet just a few hours after the show had aired. Understandably, there has been minimal authoring. Despite the running time, the quality has not been maximised by using XP mode. Instead, half the capacity of the disc is left unused. Picture and sound quality are both generally excellent, but some minor noise in the image and low contrast are noticeable. This version of the broadcast is an admirable effort to make it available quickly, but better presentations of the material will surely follow.",

        "description": "VH1's \"Storytellers\" is an occasion series that allows songwriters to perform their music and tell the stories behind the songs. Bruce used the opportunity to appear on the show to promote the release of his new album, \"Devils and Dust\".\r\nIt was by all accounts a very special evening. Bruce was charming, funny and interesting as he performed solo versions of 8 songs and then proceeded to deconstruct them line by line. His explanations provided some fascinating insight, but were also as poetic and ambiguous as the lyrics themselves at times. The show was cut down to just 43 minutes for its premier broadcast and subsequently extended to 53 minutes with the restoration of \"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\". Unfortunately, the editing is frustrating, with the post-song descriptions overlaid and interspersed with the songs themselves. Predictably for a TV broadcast, multiple versions are now in circulation. However, Digi-TOx and DVD Dubbing Guy have joined forces to produce the ultimate version of the show. \"Stories from an Only Son\" is a two-disc set with identical video content on both discs. It is an excellent digital capture of the extended cut with virtually no perceptible compression artefacts. It has been cropped to a 16:9 aspect ratio (eliminating only the black bars seen on other versions) and encoded in anamorphic widescreen. The results are truly superb. The only difference between the two discs is the audio tracks. Disc 1 contains an uncompressed PCM stereo stream, while Disc 2 has a DTS surround-sound mix. Both sound excellent if you have the right equipment to gain the full benefit. \"Stories from an Only Son\" is a \"must have\" upgrade for widescreen TV owners. A Home Cinema sound system will further enhance the experience. However, you might want to stick with your earlier versions if you only have a standard TV set.",

It is hard to find anything to fault with the picture and sound, which are virtually broadcast quality. The image is non-anamorphic widescreen and mercifully free of any logos or other on-screen graphics. The video does drop out for around 10 seconds between takes of \"The Rising\", but it resumes where it left off, so nothing is missed. The source tape has been transferred to DVD using a standalone recorder in XP Mode across three discs. This means that the third disc runs for just 17 minutes, but it is justified to retain maximum quality. Disc 2 and 3 appear to have errors which mean they fail to load in many home DVD players, but this can usually be overcome by pressing \"Stop\" and then \"Play\". \"Storytellers Uncut\" is an exceptionally good presentation of one of the most important and fascinating performances of Bruce's career. It's simply a \"must have\".",

        "description": "As part of the promotional effort for her second album \"23rd Street Lullaby\", Patti Scialfa shot a pay-per-view special for satellite broadcaster DirecTV. It contained a compilation of performances from two shows at \"The Hit Factory\" studios in front of an invited audience. Interwoven with the songs are interviews with Patti and footage from back-stage rehearsals. The band put together especially for the tapings included E Streeters Nils Lofgren and Suzie Tyrell. And yes, there is Bruce content too. Ms Scialfa's other half joins the band on guitar for two songs, but does not contribute any vocals. The image quality on this DVD standalone transfer is slightly soft, indicating the source was a VHS tape of the broadcast rather than a digital recording. Nevertheless, picture and sound are both very good. There are some pleasant performances here, but Bruce's limited participation means that you will need to be appreciative of Patti's music to want this one in your collection.",

        "description": "\"Patti on TV\" is a compilation of the chat show appearances that Patti made during June 2004 to plug her second CD \"23rd Street Lullaby\". Most of the clips follow the same format, namely some fairly vacuous chat about juggling the duties of motherhood and rock stardom, followed by a performance of one or more songs from the album (predominantly the title track). There is just enough Bruce content to warrant inclusion in the DVD Index. Ms Scialfa's other half is seen looking on proudly from the wings during the \"Today\" spot. However, his main contribution is an interview for the \"CBS Sunday Morning\" profile on the happy couple. There is minimal added production value to be found in this standalone transfer, but picture and sound quality are generally excellent throughout. This is essential stuff for Patti fans, while the more casual Bruce DVD collector will find just enough of interest in the \"CBS Sunday Morning\" segment to make it worthwhile seeking this one out.",

        "description": "Stan Goldstein has gathered together all of Bruce's TV appearances during the week of the \"Devils & Dust\" album release in April 2005 for this single disc compilation. First up is the VH1 Classic extended version of \"Storytellers\". This is identical to the original version, except for the Smokey Robinson style performance of \"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\" that has been tagged onto the end. Next is a profile that aired on NBC's \"Dateline\". Bruce is seen chatting inside Asbury Park's Paramount Theatre and strolling on the boardwalk outside with interviewer Matt Lauer. More of the same interview is used for the two \"Today Show\" segments (from consecutive mornings), which also includes exclusive performances of \"Devils & Dust\" and \"All I'm Thinking About\". Also included are two brief clips of an interview that VH1 conducted at the time of the \"Storytellers\" filming. Closing out the DVD is the stylish promo video for the \"Devils & Dust\" single that was shot in an empty Paramount Theatre. The recordings have been transferred to DVD using a standalone recorder, so there is little in the way of menu functionality. Nevertheless, picture and sound are generally excellent (apart from some very minor compression artefacts in the dark backgrounds). This material will probably be given a better presentation at a later date, but this compilation represents at welcome opportunity to see these TV appearances in excellent quality soon after they debuted.",

The attentive crowd were rewarded with the world premiere of \"All I'm Thinkin' About\" (the last song from the new album to be played live) and an ultra-rare \"Book of Dreams\" (not performed since 1992's \"Plugged\"). Other highlights for fans of classic Springsteen material included \"For You\", \"Highway Patrolman\" and \"Racing in the Streets\". Part-time Arizona resident Nils Lofgren made a surprise guest appearance for \"This Hard Land\". This excellent camcorder footage was filmed from the left and towards the back of the arena. The angle gives a side view of Bruce while he is centre-stage, but a great head-on shot while he is seated at the piano. It is generally very steady and offers some great close-ups. Picture quality is very good, but there is quite a bit of digital noise visible in the dark tones. The DVDs have been created by direct transfer of the master tape using a standalone recorder. Hence, there are no authored menus, song chapters or dubbing. Although the audio comes from the camcorder, it is remarkably clear and strong. There is some echo on the vocal, but this is probably unavoidable due to the acoustics of the venue. Despite the lack of added production value, this is an extremely enjoyable set.",

        "description": "The \"Devils & Dust\" tour's official opening took place at the Fox Theatre in Detroit on the eve of the album's release. It soon became apparent that this was no \"Tom Joad II\". There was a wider variety of musical styles, ranging from the bizarre use of the harmonica on \"Reason to Believe\" to a number of piano spots between the acoustic guitar numbers. Bruce debuted 10 of the 12 cuts from the new album, mixed with classic oldies like \"For You\" and \"Racing in the Streets\". \"The Rising\" album was also well represented with four songs. Other highlights included \"Part Man, Part Monkey\" as a commentary on Bush's fundamentalist views and a return to the original solo piano arrangement of \"Real World\". The show gets the full-blown ScrewDevil treatment on \"Living in the Light\", using footage from NYC Shows and Fig. The beautifully designed menus give way to an apt title sequence in the style of an old B&W western. The main source in the 3 cam mix is a head-on shot from waist height. The camera slowly bobs up and down throughout, but Bruce is kept in the centre of the view. This is blended with a great screen shot that is very steady and fills the frame. There is also an alternate stage angle. Picture quality is generally very good and thankfully far superior to the videos from the last solo tour. However, there is quite a lot of digital noise present in the image, particularly in the dark backgrounds. The dubbed audio gives a clear and full sound and is perfectly synchronised. \"Living in the Light\" doesn't fail to live up to the high standards we have come to expect from a ScrewDevil production. Go get your copy now.",

        "description": "Bruce's first Devils & Dust show proper in his home state of New Jersey was the 13th of the tour and it proved to be unlucky for some. A bank of speakers blew out after around 25 minutes and one section of the crowd was left without sound. Disgruntled fans started shouting out \"We can't hear you!\", but Bruce thought he was being heckled and gave them his best \"STFU\". As the chanting continued, Bruce offered to show them the door. The problem was eventually fixed and Bruce was told the reason for the ruckus. His mood softened and he joked that it was members of his family that had caused the disturbance. He said the show should be called \"Attack of the Relatives\". Hence, the title of this DVD release was instantly coined. The tour debut of \"The Wish\" was the highlight of a set list with few surprises. Other notable performances were \"Paradise\" and the new spaghetti western arrangement of \"I'm On Fire\". This excellent set from LAM Video and Cheesesteak Productions features an impressive two cam mix. One camera is high on the left side of the arena, while the other is in a rear-centre location. The picture quality from the side view (which becomes head-on when Bruce is at the piano) suffers from quite a bit of digital noise and a faint band that rolls horizontally across the screen. The central view is much better, with excellent definition and rich colours. Steadiness is good for hand-held filming and both angles provide some very nice close-ups shots. There are a couple of brief spots (mostly between songs) where there is no video at all, but these are covered by either freeze-frame or slide-show stills. The perfectly synchronised dubbed audio is taken from the \"JB\" audience tape. The vocal has quite a bit of echo and you might need to turn up the volume to follow some of the spoken intros, but this is probably an unavoidable consequence of recording in an arena. \"Attack of the Relatives\" is a quality production and a nice record of a memorable night.",

        "description": "The second night of a spectacular two-night stand in L.A. saw \"Devils & Dust\" bumped down to the third spot to make way for the tour debut of \"My Beautiful Reward\" at the top of the show. Many more tour debuts followed, including \"Empty Sky\", \"The Line\" and a new solo piano arrangement of \"The River\". \"All The Way Home\" was the last song from the new album to be played on the tour and \"If I Should Fall Behind\" was played on guitar instead of piano like the previous evening. Nils Lofgren showed up for the second time on the tour, this time to help out on an extended version of \"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\". The requisite gathering of Hollywood celebs in attendance seemed to approve of a tremendous show. \"The LA Touch\" contains a reasonably good screen-shot video of the performance. It starts during the final notes of the show opener and it is not until the third song that the filmer is able to zoom in on the screen. Once he does, he manages to hold the shot fairly steady and fill the majority of the frame. The screens at the \"Devils & Dust\" shows were not the big high-definition displays seen at recent arena and stadium appearances. Consequently, the image quality is not as good as the best screen shot videos from previous tours. The DVD uses the original cam audio, which is fairly distant but acceptably clear. Unfortunately, it is only present in one channel of the stereo soundtrack. The master tape has strangely been transferred as three separate titles on the first disc and two on the second, so the show returns to the main menu at the end of each section. The problems with the audio and claustrophobia of a screen shot which exclusively focuses on Bruce's face or hands means that \"The LA Touch\" will be of limited appeal.",

        "description": "General consensus is those lucky enough to catch Bruce between 1975 and 1981 caught a performer at the peak of his powers. This compilation of clips, some in circulation for the first time, supports this consensus and compliments the official release of the first show at Hammersmith Odeon in 1975 and bootlegs of shows in Landover during 1978 and 1980. Of particular note is the footage from 1976 and 1977, documenting a period very underrepresented in terms of video.\r\n  As the artwork notes, 8mm is a cartridge based motion picture film format that allows approximately 3 minutes 20 seconds of continuous filming. As a result, the vast majority of songs included on these DVDs are incomplete and many are only brief snippets. This leads to a compilation that is like a curate’s egg: something which is part good, part bad; a mixed bag. Some of the 8mm footage was silent and although efforts were made to dub the footage, the audio does not always match the video throughout the compilation, particularly on the first DVD. The audio has been used, it would seem, to indicate what song is most likely being played. Unfortunately, this leads to a very unsatisfying experience, although this is balanced by the outstanding work in other areas, particularly the excellent footage from New Year’s Eve in December 1980 which is dubbed in the traditional sense.\r\n  This is an interesting compilation and a good historical document for hardcore fans. That said, it is unlikely to get too many repeat viewings because of the issues highlighted above and won’t make it on to many “must-have lists”.",

        "description": "The first night of a three show \"Devils & Dust\" jaunt through Italy saw Bruce returning once again to the \"Nebraska\" album for the tour premier of \"My Father's House\". The other notable variation in the running order was at triple shot at the piano, with \"Paradise\" into \"Real World\" into \"My Hometown\". This excellent camcorder footage is shot from high on the left of the theatre. The side angle turns into a great head-on view when Bruce is seated for the piano numbers. The pans as Bruce moves position between songs are a little jagged, but otherwise the vast majority of the video is perfectly steady. However, the filmer is forced to switch from the tripod to handheld when the crowd stands for the encores. The picture is bright and sharp and although there is some digital noise evident, it is less prominent than most of the other videos from the tour. There aren't many close-up shots because the filmer avoids full zoom to minimise pixilation, but this is extremely good stuff. The camcorder sound is slightly distant, but still very clear. There is quite a bit of echo on the vocal, but this is common to most recordings from the tour. Picky viewers might notice a slight audio delay, but this doesn't really cause a distraction. Not only is this one of the best D & D audience shot videos of the tour, it stands proudly as one of the best of any tour.\r\n\r\n(Note: The audio is encode as MPEG1, which may cause problems with some standalone players, particularly the JVC brand)",

        "description": "The first night of a three show \"Devils & Dust\" jaunt through Italy saw Bruce returning once again to the \"Nebraska\" album for the tour premier of \"My Father's House\". The other notable variation in the running order was at triple shot at the piano, with \"Paradise\" into â€˜Real World\" into \"My Hometown\". \"With the Devil Snappin' at My Heels\" from SDonkey Productions features a new video of the show from \"Bazzy\". The handheld footage is shot from the back of the theatre and so the view is quite distant. There is constant camera movement and jitter, which makes viewing hard going at times. The image is clean, but it lacks definition and there is some occasional loss of focus. There are some brief cuts between some songs and the encores start shortly after the beginning of \"Land of Hope and Dreams\", thus missing \"Ramrod\". SDonkey has done a very good job authoring the set, with a clever animated title sequence and nicely designed menus. However, the real attraction is the excellent dubbed audio, which gives a clear and full sound. \"With the Devil Snappin' at My Heels\" can't come close to matching the excellent \"Luke\" video of the show (probably the best of the tour), but great production and dubbed audio make this an interesting alternative.",

The other notable variation in the set was at triple shot at the piano, with \"Paradise\" into \"Real World\" into \"My Hometown\". 'DVD Dubbing Guy' has used the excellent video from the 'Luke' version for his upgrade of the show. It is shot from high on the left of the theatre, but the side angle turns into a great head-on view for the piano numbers. The pans as Bruce moves position between songs are a little jagged, but otherwise the vast majority of the video is perfectly steady. However, the filmer is forced to switch from the tripod to handheld when the crowd stands for the encores. The picture is very sharp, but there is quite a bit of digital noise evident in the dark tones. There aren't many close-up shots because the filmer avoids full zoom to minimise pixilation, but this is extremely good stuff. The original camcorder audio has been replaced with the 'Kokomo' audience tape, resulting in a significant improvement in the sound quality. The simple 'Luke' menus have been reused, with the addition of text to identify it as the \"DVD Dubbing Guy\" version. \"Bologna 05\" is probably the best video footage from the \"Devils & Dust\" tour, so a new version with improved sound is very welcome.",

Piano versions of \"Tougher Than the Rest\", \"Real World\" and \"Racing in the Street\" meant that the respectful Brussels crowd were treated to a good set. This handheld camcorder footage is shot from a central position at the back of the theatre, giving a somewhat distant view. Unfortunately, the camerawork is very poor. It is extremely shaky, with Bruce frequently shooting out of the frame altogether. There are constant switches between stage and screen and the zoom is used excessively. The image is clean, but definition is low and the colours seem washed out. All in all, the video is near unwatchable. To make matters worse, authoring errors make disc navigation impossible on most standalone players. Disc 2 is particularly bad, with second half of the show split among four disc Titles in the wrong order. The only redeeming feature is the audio, which is good for a camcorder. The shaky video and broken menus mean that only collectors who must have every available DVD from the tour will want this one.",

The filmer constantly switches from stage to screen, but the screen only occupies around half the frame. The picture quality is very clean, but the focus is forever drifting and so the image is often blurred. The audio is average for a camcorder source. The DVD begins with a very brief title sequence, but there are no menus or even chapter stops. Unusually, the disc had been authored in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen.

        "description": "The last night of the three show mini-tour of Italy fell on the eve of Bruce's 14th wedding anniversary to Patti. Romance was definitely in the air, with three consecutive tales of separated lovers (\"Tougher Than the Rest\", the tour premier of \"Open All Night\" and \"All the Way Home\"). \"Brilliant Disguise\" and \"Lucky Town\" both stayed from the night before, but the best spot in an excellent setlist was the piano combo of \"Wreck on the Highway\" leading into the tour premier of \"Lost in the Flood\". This excellent camcorder footage is shot from high on the right of the theatre. This gives a side view of Bruce while he is centre stage, but a back view while he is seated at the piano. The camera appears to be mounted on a tripod, but frequent angle adjustment makes the view quite shaky at times. The filmer also tends to be overenthusiastic with the zoom, but the shot is rock steady on the occasions when the camera is left alone. Image quality is mostly very sharp, except for some pixilation on the extreme close-ups. The colours are rich and the dark backgrounds are pleasingly solid. Inexplicably, there are short cuts between most songs and this can become mildly irritating. Audio from the camcorder is very clear, although a little heavy on the echo. The discs are authored with simple yet attractive menu designs. It should be noted that both discs have a minor error which means that one song on each can't be selected. The excellent picture quality makes Milan '05 one of the best videos from the first European leg of the Devils & Dust tour. It is just a shame the camera angle wasn't held steadier more often. (Note: The audio is encode as MPEG1, which may cause problems with some standalone players, particularly the JVC brand).",

This one is shot with a handheld camera from relatively low on the left side of the theatre. The filmer does an admirable job of keeping a reasonably steady and centred view, but there is constant camera movement throughout. The image is a little overexposed, but otherwise sharp and mercifully free of pixilation or noise. The audio is very good, given that it comes from the camcorder. So far, so good. However, there seems to be a problem with the aspect ratio. The video has been transferred at a resolution of PAL 704x576 rather than the more common PAL 720x576 and it appears that it may even have been shot in widescreen mode. Whatever the cause, the result is a slightly squashed Bruce when viewed on a native 4:3 display (e.g. a standard TV set). Things look more natural if stretched on a 16:9 display. The authored menus also add to the wackiness, with separate sub-menus for each track instead of a single song selection sub-menu. \"Wreck in Milan\" is a reasonable alternative to the original release, but if you only want one version of the show, then stick to the 'Luke' version.",

The setlist featured nine songs not played the night before in Hamburg, including tour premieres of \"Sinaloa Cowboys\" and \"Hungry Heart\" (which featured the obligatory German guest appearance by Wolfgang Niedecken). \"Adam Raised a Cain\" was reprised from Stockholm as the opener and \"Spare Parts\" was retained after its tour debut the previous evening. This DVD from \"Sunny Day\" is certainly one of the stranger presentations of any show from the tour. It is authored as 9 separate Titles, each of which returns the viewer to the animated main menu upon completion. The first of these is named \"Speech\" and consists of several fragments of spoken introductions followed by the first line or two of the proceeding song from throughout the show. The remainder of the Titles are individual songs which are (mostly) complete. The handheld footage is shot from a central location at the back of the theatre. The filmer frequently switches his view from stage to screen (or both at the same time in some cases). Bruce only fills around a half of the frame or less during the screen views and the stage views are mostly very distant. The angle also tends to wander around quite a bit. The picture quality is generally good, but the auto focus occasionally struggles and some shots are overexposed. The camcorder audio is reasonable, but quite hollow and echo laden. This might serve as a nice memento for members of the audience, but casual collectors can safely ignore.",

The first DVD from the show to circulate was an incomplete collection of fragmented clips, so it is nice to finally get the complete performance. This footage (a completely different source than the first) is shot from a tripod on the left side of the arena. There are some lengthy periods of perfectly steady close-up views. Unfortunately, the shot gets extremely shaky whenever the filmer makes an adjustment and it can take quite a while to re-establish a stable angle. The picture quality is generally very good, but a combination of full zoom and compression due to squeezing the whole show on a single disc leads to quite a bit of grain. The cam audio is reasonably clear, but sounds fairly hollow. \"The Final Show\" is a mixed bag of some great rock-steady close-ups interleaved with near-unwatchable shaky spells. Copious use of the fast forward button to pick out the best bits makes this an enjoyable watch.",

        "description": "This astounding interview was conducted in Los Angeles by renowned Australian rock journalist Ian 'Molly' Meldrum as part of the promotional push for the \"Greatest Hits\" album in 1995. It is extraordinary on a number of levels, making it undoubtedly one of the most fascinating interviews of Bruce's career ever committed to film. Bruce and his management keep tight control of his contact with the media. Questions must be submitted beforehand and follow-ups are generally not allowed. However, Molly Meldrum had other ideas. He was granted just 15 minutes, but was determined to get a much longer interview that he could use for a worldwide syndicated TV special. He was impeccably polite, but refused to relent on his persistent line of questioning. The interview starts in conventional fashion, but Meldrum quickly throws in a question that isn't on the approved list. Bruce seems intrigue, but his minders (who are just off-camera) are less amused. The tension grows and Bruce starts to cast glances to someone else in the room. The questions are unique and insightful, drawing on the in-depth knowledge of someone who is obviously a dedicated fan. Examples include questions on an unreleased album recorded in 1986 and the verse about Bruce's father that was deleted from \"Glory Days\". Bruce seems to be caught off-guard at times, but he remains in good spirits throughout. It was admirable that Bruce let the interview continue, despite the fact that he was clearly being signalled to end it. This is probably because Meldrum was smart enough to avoid questions of a personal nature and the issue of bootlegs is cleverly circumvented when it comes up. After a gruelling 90 minutes, the interview is finally called to a halt. Springsteen's management (who are never seen on camera) were apparently furious at what unfolded and they refused to allow Meldrum to use more than the originally allocated 15 minutes, so the TV Special never came to fruition. However, we can now finally get to see the marathon session in its unedited entirety. The DVD is a simple presentation of what is probably a 2nd generation VHS copy. The entire running time consists of a single head-and-shoulders fixed angle shot. Picture quality is generally very good, but there are occasional flickers of interference and the colour has shifted towards red. The audio is perfectly adequate, but there is minor hiss and distortion throughout. If any interview could be described as essential, then \"1995 Molly Meldrum Interview\" is it. (Thanks go to \"Earthslayer\" for the background information used in this review)",

        "description": "Rome was the first \"Devils & Dust\" show in over a month not to have \"My Beautiful Reward\" as the opener. Instead, Bruce entered the stage to the haunting strains of Ennio Morricone's \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" theme and then dedicated the new spaghetti western arrangement of \"I'm on Fire\" to the home town composer. \"Brilliant Disguise\" and \"Lucky Town\" made their tour premieres and long-time fans were treated to piano versions of \"Incident on 57th Street\" and \"Racing in the Street\". The camcorder footage featured on this DVD was shot from a tripod high on the left side of the theatre. This gives a side view when Bruce is on guitar, but a head-on view when he takes a seat at the piano. It is extremely steady when the filmer holds a fixed angle, but the pans are very shaky. Picture quality is very good, but the view is a little more distant than the best videos of the tour and there is quite a bit of digital noise in the dark backgrounds. The camcorder audio is disappointingly hollow and heavily laden with echo. As a very nice bonus, the set also features a short special that aired on Italian TV. Interspersed among the promo clips and original interview (with overdubbed Italian translation) are some brief clips of pro-shot footage from the Bologna and Milan \"Devils & Dust\" shows. The pro-shot clips are a pleasant surprise, but the very good footage in the main feature is let down by the audio.",

Picture quality is good, but the view is a little more distant than the best videos of the tour and there is quite a bit of digital noise in the dark backgrounds. The original camcorder audio was very disappointing, so the dubbed source lifted from the 'Godfather Records' release used here is a big improvement. There are some problems with the synchronisation in places, but the distant view means that you have to look hard to notice them. \"Racing in the Street\" now continues with audio only at the point where the video cuts. The discs include song selection menus with a somewhat unimaginative layout. \"Once Upon a Time in Rome\" is a reasonable attempt to upgrade the original release, but the basic disc design and variable synch is a little disappointing.",

        "description": "The Hamburg \"Devils & Dust\" show turned out to be the penultimate night of the European tour after being rescheduled from earlier in the month. Bruce rewarded the home town crowd for their patience with tour premiers of \"Janey, Don't Loose Heart\" (on electric piano), \"Spare Parts\" and \"Growin Up\". Other rarities included \"Highway 29\" and \"Highway Patrolman\". The pump-organ \"Downbound Train\" stayed from its debut during the previous show as the opener. Only some of those performances are included on this single DVD of select songs from the show. Luckily, the supreme \"Janey...\" is among the songs captured when the filmer chose to turn on his camera. The tracks are mostly complete, but some are faded out a little early. The footage is shot from the left of the theatre, which gives a side view for the guitar numbers and a head-on view of Bruce at the piano. The picture quality is mercifully free of the digital noise that mars most of the videos from the tour, but there is some pixilation when the filmer uses maximum zoom. It is reasonably steady and carefully filmed, with a good colour balance. The audio is very good for a camcorder source. Unusually for camcorder video, the transfer is anamorphic widescreen. The disc has been authored with interesting menu designs and despite being incomplete, it is a very nice presentation of the show.",

        "description": "Frankfurt saw \"Into the Fire\" stay as the show opener from the first German \"Devils & Dust\" show in Munich. The electric \"Open All Night\" returned to the set and \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\" got its first European outing of the tour. The other main highlight was a rare triple shot at the piano with \"For You\", \"Two Faces\" and \"The River\". Unfortunately, none of those performances make an appearance on this DVD. Instead, we get nine songs (all cut) from the last part of the main set and the encores. The filmer moves position between some of the songs, so we get to see Bruce from several different angles. All of the shots are from the same high level at the back of the theatre and are fairly unsteady. Obstructions from the audience and stage rigging are a constant problem. The picture quality is reasonable, but it lacks the crisp definition that we have seen on other videos from the tour. It is overexposed at times and there are some strange green/brown tints. Most annoyingly, there is a small white spot that dances around the centre of the frame for the first few songs. The spot looks like a firefly and you might find yourself wishing that Bruce would just turn around and swat the damn thing. The DVD is saved by the dubbed audio. The strong and full sound makes it worthwhile persevering with the full 45 minute run time. The disc is authored with a very simple main menu, but no song selection menu. This one falls firmly into the \"nice souvenir for those that were there\" category.",

        "description": "When Bruce arrived at the Flanders Expo arena in Ghent for the first of his two \"Human Touch/Lucky Town\" shows, he found himself being filmed by a local TV news crew. A compilation of the resulting footage has now surfaced on \"Till I Die... Ghent 93\" from \"JoJo\". The footage is divided into three sections. The first (and most interesting) sees Bruce soundchecking \"Lucky Town\" and \"I Ain't Got No Home\" in the empty arena. This is followed by a backstage interview and finally clips from three consecutive songs from the show. All three sections run for around 10 minutes each. The stage video is a series of relatively short snippets rather than complete performances. The source appears to be a second or third generation VHS copy of the master. Picture quality is very good, with only a small amount of generation loss visible. There are some slight pauses and stutters throughout, but this doesn't detract too much from this extremely enjoyable video. The sound comes from a boom mike rather than the soundboard, but is nevertheless very clear. The animated menu gives access to some novel bonus material. This consists of the news broadcasts that made use of the same raw video and a slide show of local newspaper and magazine clippings. These clippings are also available on the disc as high res .pdf files. \"Till I Die... Ghent 93\" is an excellently produced DVD of some great pro shot footage. A \"must have\" for fans of the period.",

        "description": "\"Summer of 88\" from Stan Goldstein is a compilation of primarily TV news coverage during the period January to September 1988 (if only summer really was nine months long). The contents are as follow: - A segment from the ITV's (not BBC, as listed on the menu) \"TV-am\", covering the Wembley Stadium show on 25 June. It includes several live clips. - A segment from the UK Channel 4 (again not BBC, as listed on the menu) magazine show \"Wired\".  It features footage of Asbury Park and interviews with locals who have tenuous connections to Bruce. Clips from the Birmingham show on 21 June are also included. - The SOS Racism Rally in Paris on 18 June. - A Dutch TV news segment featuring clips from the Rotterdam show on 29 June. . - A segment from the Italian TV show \"Notte Rock\", featuring footage from the Turin show on 11 June. . - A complete \"Be True\" from the Mountain View show on 2 May. . - \"Can't Help Fallin' in Love\" from the Berlin broadcast on 19 July. . - The camcorder footage of Bruce busking on the streets of Copenhagen, 23 July. . - TV commercials for the \"Video Anthology\", \"Tunnel of Love\" and the radio broadcast of the Stockholm show. . - A BBC TV news report on the Amnesty Tour, including Bruce's appearance at a press conference on 1 September. . - Coverage of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony on 20 January, including a lengthy clip of Bruce's speech inducting Bob Dylan. Picture quality ranges from excellent (Mountainview, SOS Racism) to poor (Dutch and Italian TV broadcasts). Much of the material will be familiar to veteran collectors and some of it has previously circulated in better quality (e.g. Turin, Berlin). There are some real gems here though, including the great quality Mountainview clip and the snippets from the UK shows. The chapter selection menus are strangely split in two halves and the captions are somewhat ambiguous (or as noted, wrong). Nevertheless, \"Summer of 88\" does a nice job of capturing a varied and exciting year in Bruce's career. It is interesting and enjoyable viewing.",

        "description": "\"Soundcheck\" is a somewhat bizarre compilation of previously circulated clips from the late '70s and early '80s. It kicks off with the well-known closed-circuit soundcheck footage from Passaic '78. The black and white image is dark and grainy, making it quite hard to distinguish Bruce from the general murk. However, the rarity value and good sound makes it worth a viewing or two. Conversely, the clip from Bruce's guest spot with Southside Johnny on New Year's Eve 1979 is not worth even a few seconds of your time. This has been available for some time in excellent quality, but the version here is abysmal. Generation loss has rendered it unwatchable. The pro-shot footage shot from Buffalo '84 is much better (but that is not hard). It is a single camera view of \"Cadillac Ranch\", \"Pink Cadillac\" and \"Born to Run\" from the right side of the arena. Generation loss is again evident and there is a large counter across the screen, but it is still enjoyable stuff. Next is part of the \"Old Grey Whistle Test\" special from 1985, including a segment of the interview, a live clip of \"Cover Me\" and the \"Dancing in the Dark\" promo. Quality is similar to the other (complete) versions in circulation. The disc finishes with some random TV clips of other artists (Dylan on Letterman, an early Johnny Cash appearance and some unidentified children on an ancient '50s variety show). You also get 20 minutes of blank screen for good measure. There is no authoring, just a basic standalone transfer of a VHS tape. If you don't already have the Passaic soundcheck or Buffalo '84 footage, then this is as good a way as any to pick them up. Otherwise, give this one a miss.",

        "description": "By the time the \"Devils & Dust\" Tour rolled into Bridgeport, a generous scattering of rare performances and tour premiers had almost become the norm. The packed arena was treated to the longest set yet, with a total of 27 songs. There were seven songs at the keyboard, including the first tour outings for \"All That Heaven Will Allow\" and \"Nothing Man\". Other highlights included \"Highway 29\", \"Lost in the Flood\" and \"Spare Parts\". Among the Connecticut crowd were fellow songwriters Jesse Malin (to whom Bruce dedicated \"The Promise\") and Suicide's Alan Vega (who wrote the standard show closer, \"Dream Baby Dream\"). There was also an amusing repetition of the infamous incident in New Jersey on the first leg of the tour when Bruce admonished the crowd for yelling and later apologised when he was told there was a PA fault. However, he couldn't resist adding \"If it wasn't that, go fuck yourself\". This LAM Video/Silver Stallion Production features a video shot from the right side of the arena. Picture quality is very good, although use of full zoom which gives some very nice close-up views does result in a fair amount of grain. Thankfully though, the dark backgrounds are free from the noise that mars many of the other videos from the tour. The filmer manages to hold a steady shot during most of the performance, but things get a bit shaky when Bruce moves stage position between songs. It takes a while to re-establish a stable view, but the worst of these transitions are replaced with stills montages while the sound continues uninterrupted. This is very effective at smoothing out the rough spots, but the predominance of early era images strikes as anachronistic. Some of the piano songs are filmed from the arena screen, with good quality results. The audio comes from a very clear audience recording. The dubbing is spot on most of the time, but a glitch just before the last track on Disc 1 throws out the synchronisation for all of \"Racing in the Street\". The authored menus use background video clips to good effect. The close-up views, mostly steady camera work and strong dubbed audio makes \"Bridgeport 05\" one of the better DVDs from the \"Devils and Dust\" tour. It is a good representation of the stand-out third leg and well worth adding to your collection.",

        "description": "The colourfully titled \"Sit Back, Relax and Shut The Fuck Up !\" is a compilation of songs from the two Royal Albert Hall shows at the start of the European leg of the \"Devils & Dust\" tour. There are four songs from each night, both filmed with the same handheld camera from a very similar location on the right side of the theatre. The two nights appear on the disc in reverse order, but this puts the songs in the sequence that they appeared in the shows. The view is fairly unsteady and there are occasional obstructions. The image quality is a little soft and the camcorder audio is about average for the source. It is all held to gather with some very basic menus. Total running time is just 34 minutes, but this does include the memorable moment when Bruce found himself in the arms of attractive twin blondes during Ramrod. In lieu of either complete show emerging in trading circles, \"Sit Back, Relax and Shut The Fuck Up !\" offers those that were there a reasonable memento of the occasion. For others, it is unlikely to get many repeat plays after the initial viewing.",

        "description": "The Netherlands' only \"Devils & Dust\" show fell on Father's Day and so it was no surprise that Bruce opened with \"Adam Raised a Cain\" and later followed up with \"My Father's House\". A piano triple shot of \"For You\", \"Two Faces\" and \"The River\" was complimented later by another trip to the keyboards for \"Countin' on a Miracle\" leading into \"Racing in the Street\". A six number encore stretched the set out to a total of 26 songs. This single disc DVD uses a video shot from the left side of the arena. The camera appears to be on a tripod, but there is still quite a bit of movement and occasional obstructions. Picture quality is generally good, with quite a bit of detail visible and pleasingly solid dark tones. The sound is also good for a camcorder source. The big problem is that the camera is mounted at an angle until well into the main set and again at the end, giving the appearance that Bruce is standing on a slope. You might find yourself fearing that he could topple backwards at any time. \"Rotterdam Ahoy\" is a reasonably good example of a DVD from the tour, as long as you are prepared to watch two thirds of it with your head tilted to one side.",

        "description": "Dusseldorf was the third of three consecutive German shows on the European leg of the \"Devils & Dust\" tour and Bruce obviously thought it was time for a serious set list shake up. There was a total of twelve changes from the previous night in Frankfurt, including tour premiers of \"Highway 29\" (for the first time since the \"Ghost of Tom Joad\" tour) and both \"I Wish I Were Blind\" and \"Mary's Place\" on piano. Also on piano were \"Incident on 57th Street\", \"Tougher Than the Rest\" and the always welcome \"Racing in the Street\". That only left room for seven songs from \"Devils & Dust\", with no \"Leah\" for the first time. \"'Neath The Arms Of Cassiopeia\" from \"brucevideos\" uses handheld camcorder footage shot from the left side of the theatre, giving a nice head-on view when Bruce is at the keyboards. It is reasonably steady for a handheld, but the camera is tilted slightly to one side at times. There are a couple of brief cuts for tape swaps and things get a lot shakier towards the end of the encores. The picture quality is very clean, but the definition is a little soft and the view a little distant. The dubbed audio comes from a good audience tape from 'Vortex'. The DVD comes complete with a basic song selection menu. \"'Neath The Arms Of Cassiopeia\" is certainly one of the better DVDs from the tour, but not quite up there with the very best.",

There was a total of twelve changes from the previous night in Frankfurt, including tour premiers of \"Highway 29\" (for the first time since the \"Ghost of Tom Joad\" tour) and both \"I Wish I Were Blind\" and \"Mary's Place\" on piano. Also on piano were \"Incident on 57th Street\", \"Tougher Than the Rest\" and the always welcome \"Racing in the Street\". That only left room for seven songs from \"Devils & Dust\", with no \"Leah\" for the first time. The 'JoJo' version of the show uses a completely different video than the one found on \"'Neath The Arms Of Cassiopeia\" from 'brucevideos'. It is essentially a series of clips because the filmer turns the camera off after every song. Consequently, most of the between-song chat and opening lines are missing. Two performances (\"Reno\" and \"The Hitter\") are absent entirely. The video quality is very much a good news/bad news/good news story. The good news is that the image is beautifully clean with solid and natural tones. It is completely free of the low level digital noise that plagues most videos from the tour. However, the bad news is that the camerawork is extremely shaky. The constant camera movement, coupled with overenthusiastic use of the zoom, leads to frequent loss of autofocus lock and so the picture often degenerates into a blur. Now back to the good news. The filmer takes up a position standing on a seat just a few rows back from the stage at the start of the encores and gets some terrific close-up shots. The audio is reasonably good, considering it comes from the cam. Clips of three songs from Frankfurt are also included, but camera shake renders them virtually unwatchable. The single DVD is authored with simple menus, which it should be noted contain a couple of errors (\"Tougher Than The Rest\" is mislabelled as \"Tunnel of Love\" and \"Further On Up The Road\" is not listed, although it does appear on the disc). To be fair to the filmer, he probably shot the video for his personal enjoyment only and so we should be thankful that he agreed to share. However, unless you have a personal attachment to this particular show, you are unlikely to return to this DVD after the first play.",

Nevertheless, there are some amazing close-up views. The camcorder audio is unfortunately distant sounding and laden with echo. This DVD contains some of the best amateur shots of the tour ('any' tour, for that matter) and is a tremendous testament to the balls of the filmer.",

        "description": "The professional film crew were back for the second night in Boston for what might eventually become the official release from the Devils & Dust tour. Bruce wildly mixed up the set so that only ten songs were repeated from the first show. The intensity level was upped too, with dramatic performances of \"Cautious Man\", \"Real World\" and \"Open All Night\". \"Lost in the Flood\" was included as a nod to the old-time fans and there was a bullet mic reading of \"Johnny 99\". However, the biggest surprise was the impromptu cover of \"Dirty Water\" between the previously inseparable \"Promised Land\" and \"Dream Baby Dream\". On a lighter note, Bruce expanded the \"hidden love songs\" rap to explain the real hidden question was \"will you pull your pants down\". The amateur camcorder footage featured on this DVD was shot from the left side at the back of the theatre. It is handheld and so there is some camera movement throughout, but the filmer does a good job of preventing things from ever getting shaky. The picture is a bit dark and murky, but still acceptably good. The audio is strong and clear, but sadly the sync with the video is lost during the encores. The menus are exceptionally good, using a clever old-style movie theme. This is an enjoyable DVD, but the sync problems at the end of the second disc need fixing to elevate this to one of the better sets from the tour.",

        "description": "The professional film crew were back for the second night in Boston for what might eventually become the official release from the Devils & Dust tour. Bruce wildly mixed up the set so that only ten songs were repeated from the first show. The intensity level was upped too, with dramatic performances of \"Cautious Man\", \"Real World\" and \"Open All Night\". \"Lost in the Flood\" was included as a nod to the old-time fans and there was a bullet mic reading of \"Johnny 99\". However, the biggest surprise was the impromptu cover of \"Dirty Water\" between the previously inseparable \"Promised Land\" and \"Dream Baby Dream\". On a lighter note, Bruce expanded the \"hidden love songs\" rap to explain the real hidden question was \"will you pull your pants down\". The amateur camcorder footage featured on this DVD was shot from the left side at the back of the theatre. It is handheld and so there is some camera movement throughout, but the filmer does a good job of preventing things from ever getting shaky. The picture is a bit dark and murky, but still acceptably good. The audio is strong and the sync problems on the original version have now thankfully been fixed. A new Bonus Feature has been added to distinguish this version from the first release with the sync error. It is previously unseen camcorder clip of \"Lonesome Day\" from the Foxboro show towards the end of \"The Rising\" tour. Picture and sound quality are both crisp, but it suffers badly from constant crowd obstructions. The menus are exceptionally good, using a clever old-style movie theme. Although the picture quality is not quite as sharp as the best from the European leg, Boston 05 is still among the most enjoyable DVD sets from the tour.",

        "description": "The penultimate stop on the \"Devils and Dust\" tour was a make-up show that had been postponed and relocated due to a hurricane the previous month. The Florida fans were rewarded for the wait when two E Street Band members made guest appearances. Steve Van Zandt and local resident Clarence Clemons first came out for \"Drive All Night\". Steve returned for \"Two Hearts\" and the trio reformed in the encore for \"Thundercrack\". The casino setting inspired the tour premier of \"Roll of the Dice\" and rarities \"Fade Away\" and \"Meeting Across the River\" also made welcome returns. \"Santa Ana\" was back too, dedicated to all the \"obsessive-compulsives\" among the somewhat rowdy audience. This Mad Raving Stark Film was shot with a handheld camcorder from the balcony high on the left side of the hall. It is predictably unsteady and the filmer struggles to get a clear view at times. However, when it is good, it is very very good indeed. There are some very nice close-up shots, with pleasingly clear picture quality. The sound is about as good as you would expect from a camcorder mike. \"Hollywood 05\" is an average video of a memorable show.",

        "description": "Hartford saw yet another radical shake-up of the set list, opening with two numbers on electric piano (\"Back in Your Arms\" and \"Wreck on the Highway\") and breaking out the ukulele on \"I Wanna Marry You\". Other highlights included the totally reworked \"The Ties that Bind\" and the recently debuted \"Idiot's Delight\". \"You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)\" made its \"Devils and Dust\" tour premier. Unfortunately, these performances are all missing on the incomplete \"Incident in Hartford\" from BlackLab Productions. What we do get to see includes the classics \"Lost in the Flood\" and \"Incident...\", as well the other tour premier (\"Something in the Night\"). The handheld camcorder video is shot from a central location just a few rows back from the stage. Understandably, it is very unsteady and there are constant obstructions. However, there are some great close-up views at times, particularly during piano numbers. The picture quality is bright and sharp and the audio has been dubbed from the good audience recording from JB (although the sync isn't quite perfect in a couple of places). There is also an interesting set of bonus material included. The U2 guest appearance is a little blurry and the audio is poor, but it is a priceless moment nonetheless. The CBS Early Show segment features a comprehensive look at the making of \"Born To Run\" (timed to coincide with the release of the 30th Anniversary box set) including new interviews with Bruce, Steve Van Zandt and Jon Landau. The NBC Today Show performances will already be familiar to most collectors. It is disappointing that so many of the best tracks from the show are missing, but the close-up views and Extras make \"Incident in Hartford\" one of the better DVDs from the tour.",

        "description": "Bruce's first show in the Nassau Coliseum since 1992 was unusual for not featuring a \"Devils and Dust\" tour premier, but the slightly sparse crowd was still treated to a nicely varied set. The first nine songs came from eight different albums, including \"Stolen Car\" as the opener, followed by \"Living Proof\" on pump organ. Next up was \"Idiot's Delight\", meaning the new album's title track was relegated to the four spot. \"Johnny 99\" on bullet mic returned for the first time since early in the tour and the ukulele came out for \"I Wanna Marry You\". \"Solo in Nassau\" is a two cam mix sourced from videos shot from opposite sides of the arena with handheld cameras. Both angles are very similar in quality, with low definition and quite a bit of grain in the image. They are also both quite unsteady. That said, it is all still very watchable. The audio comes from one of the camcorders and is reasonable enough. The standalone transfer has strangely been spanned across three discs, even though the bitrate used would easily allow the whole show to fit onto two discs. \"Solo in Nassau\" is reasonably enjoyable, but look for the authored two disc version instead of this one.",

        "description": "Bruce's anecdotes during his \"Devils & Dust\" show in Charlotte clearly revealed a fondness for the city in what was a warm and relaxed performance. \"Long Time Coming\" was prefaced with reminiscences about his cousin Frank and he joked the inspiration for setting \"All I'm Thinkin' About\" in 'Caroline' was simply because it rhymed with 'wine'. Musical highlights included back-to-back \"Tunnel of Love\" rarities on the keyboards (\"When You're Alone/Two Faces\") and a strong return to the piano for the triple-shot of \"Nothing Man\", \"Real World\" and \"Racing In The Street\". \"Highway Patrolman\" was dedicated to a local anti - Death Penalty organisation and the encores kicked off with a pair of classic oldies (\"Blinded By The Light\" and a loose \"Wild Billy's Circus Story\"). 'A Circus Town Is Born' from 'Cheesesteak Productions' features a 'Pavids & Ducci Film'. The opening song is shot from a reasonably steady handheld at the back of the arena. The picture quality is bright and sharp, with only minor amounts of digital noise in the dark backgrounds. After a short cut (the first of a few brief between-song edits), \"Reason to Believe\" is seen from a terrific angle from the floor in front of the stage. The picture quality is soft and grainy, but this source offers some amazing close-ups. The rest of the show continues with a mix of these complimentary views up to \"Matamoros Banks\", when it returns to the first source only. The video is accurately dubbed with excellent audience recorded audio from 'JB'. The title sequence and menu designs use a \"Circus Story\" theme and Disc 2 features Bruce's duet with Patti on \"Brilliant Disguise\" from the final CAA show towards the end of the tour as a Bonus. The picture quality of the bonus clip is very sharp and the sound is good, but the view is a little distant. The remarkable close-ups, great sound and high production values make 'A Circus Town Is Born' one of the very best sets from the tour. Miss it at your peril.",

        "description": "This was first show since the release of the Born to Run 30th Anniversary box.  Bruce must of known this as he dedicated \"Backstreets\" with a \"happy anniversary,\" to Jon Landau.  Set list highlights besides \"Backstreets\" include the second tour performance of \"The Wall,\" the first-ever \"Does This Bus Stop\" on ukulele, \"Santa Ana\" in the main set and \"Thundercrack\" in the encore.\r\n \r\nThe camcorder footage is shot from the 2nd level center stage straight back.  The camera is hand held so there is some movement at times.  Also, because of the filmers location and the lack of the people sitting around him to stay in their seats, the filmer is forced to switch to filming the screen for several songs (See track listing below for details).  This results in the image quality to become very grainy due to the type of screens used at the arena.  The video quailty of the stage shot is soft and a little grainy but overall is fine.\r\n \r\nThe DVDs have been created by direct transfer of the master tape using a standalone recorder. Hence, there are no authored menus, song chapters or dubbing. Although the audio comes from the camcorder, it is remarkably clear and strong with some echo on the vocal.",

        "description": "Another amazing night for Philly with two tour debuts.  \"Born in the U.S.A\" opened the first of two Spectrum shows on bullet mic, and \"Drive All Night,\" which hadn't been heard in concert since the European leg of the River tour (6/7/81).  Other rarities included  \"The Ties That Bind,\" \"Fade Away\",  \"Be True.\" Plus, \"Highway 29,\" \"Atlantic City\" on guitar, and \"Open All Night\" in the encore.\r\n This single cam version of the first night in Philly was shot on a tripod.  The filmer stays \"head to knee\" on all the guitar songs, the only downside being when Bruce moves his head gets cut off the screen from time to time(although this is being quite picky).  As for Piano songs, the filmer keeps him right in the middle of the screen for an excellent shot.  As stated in other reviews, the picture quality is a little \"soft and grainy\" compared to some of the other new shows out there.  This is especially apparent when the stage lighting is more illuminated, but being shot on a tripod more than makes up for it.  There is also very little zooming, with the exception of \"The Promised Land\" and \"Dream Baby Dream\", when the filmer pans out to get a great wide shot.  Only the first half of \"Jesus Was An Only Son\" is filmed due to a tape change.  The standalone menu is the same style for this show as for the next night (11-9).  The audio, even though not dubbed, is surprisingly solid.\r\n Overall this is a very strong show from the last leg of the D&D tour, had the filmer added menus/chapters and dubbed audio, it could have been better, but its still toward the top for the tour.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ",

        "description": "Bruce is infamous for pulling out something special for Philadelphia crowds and the first of two \"Devils and Dust\" shows at The Spectrum was no exception. The tour premier of \"Born in the USA\" on bullet mic was used as the opener, but the real surprise was the first outing of \"Drive All Night\" since the \"River\" tour nearly 25 years earlier. \"Fade Away\", \"Be True\" and the reworked \"The Ties That Bind\" complete the strong \"River\" era representation. \"Open All Night\" in the encores helped wrap up a wild night. \"Tonight There's Fallen Angels\" from 'Cheesesteak Productions' features a previously uncirculated video of the show filmed by 'Fig'. It is shot from a central location at the back of the arena to give a relatively head-on vantage point. The handheld camerawork inevitably suffers from some slight jitter and the view is a little distant, but the picture quality is otherwise very good indeed. Bruce remains centre frame throughout and the rich colour tones are pleasingly solid. The accurately dubbed audio from 'Nicky C' is amazingly clear for an audience recording. Both instrumentation and vocal are extremely detailed and it is hard to image that an audience tape could sound much better. Also worthy of special mention are the beautiful graphics featured in the opening title sequence and menus. 'GChord' has also contributed another masterpiece for the cover art. It all adds up to a production of outstanding quality. The video doesn't quite match the very best of the tour, but the excellent audio and superb design makes \"Tonight There's Fallen Angels\" another unmissable title from the House of 'Cheesesteak'.",

        "description": "Bruce has become renowned for producing something special for his Philadelphia audiences, but nobody could have predicted what he would pull out of the bag for the second of two shows during the final month of the \"Devils and Dust\" tour. \"Santa Ana\" was played live for the first time in '32 years' and while most of the crowd were trying to figure out what they had just heard, he followed with the equally unexpected \"Thundercrack\". The third tour premiere was \"Used Cars\" and \"Independence Day\" made only its second appearance. Rare visits from \"Adam Raised a Cain\", \"Janey...\" and \"Cynthia\" added to a total of 41 songs performed across the two night stand. The evening was wrapped up with a version of \"Dream Baby Dream\" that clocked in at a full 10 minutes. This single cam video was shot from a tripod on the left side of the arena. The perfectly steady shot is a pleasant change from the constantly bobbing view we normally get, but it is let down slightly by the soft and grainy picture quality. The average audio is typical for a camcorder source. This is a standalone recorder transfer, so there are no menus or song chapters. It should also be noted that most of \"Jesus Was an Only Son (start only)\" is lost from the transition between discs. The steady camerawork lifts this one above the crowd, but there is still plenty of room for improvement.",

The 'Atlantic City Productions' version of the show is a mix of two reasonably steady handheld cameras on opposite sides of the arena. The right side source gives a view with very nice picture quality. The definition is sharp and there is virtually no low level digital noise. The left side camera is unfortunately much poorer, with a soft and grainy image. The audio comes from one of the cameras and is reasonable, but a little distant. Both discs come with a short title sequence, but no authored menus or chaptering. The bitrate is also inexplicably low, with over half the capacity of the two discs going unused. Anyone expecting a fully polished production will be disappointed with this effort. Nevertheless, two cam mixes are always welcome and this one still offers a nice alternative to the earlier version.",

        "description": "The second of two nights at the Continental Airlines Arena in New Jersey during the final month of the \"Devil & Dust\" tour featured a stellar set list. Celebration of the \"Born to Run\" 30th anniversary continued with the first ever solo piano \"Meeting Across the River\" and the tour premier of the 1975 album's title track. Many of the rarities were performed as dedications, including \"Two for the Road\" to Sirius Radio's Scott Greenstein, \"Used Cars\" to Bruce's father, \"Frankie\" to a Dutch fan and his son, and \"Drive All Night\" to another fan named Maria. There was no need to dedicate \"Brilliant Disguise\" because Patti appeared in person to perform the song as a duet. The great set list was matched by a warm and relaxed performance, with no sign of the cold that had hampered Bruce the previous night. This no-frills standalone transfer of the show features a video shot from the back of the arena for a relatively head-on view. The filmer primarily concentrates on the stage, but switches to the screen for the keyboard numbers. The camerawork is generally very steady, but there is the odd moment when Bruce wanders out of frame. The picture quality is decidedly average, with quite a bit of low level digital noise in the dark background. The camcorder audio is a little muffled, but otherwise very listenable. The more attentive viewers will notice there is a slight problem with the audio/video sync throughout Disc 2. There is much to enjoy here, but the underwhelming quality of the picture and sound detracts from one of the better shows of the tour.",

        "description": "Bruce returned to Madison a year after the Kerry Election Rally for his first actual concert in the city since \"The River\" tour nearly 25 years early. He marked the occasion with a flurry of early material, including \"Incident...\", \"Lost in the Flood\" and a triple bill of \"Growin' Up\", \"Wild Billy's Circus Story\", and \"Blinded By the Light\" in the encores. Rarely performed songs from later in his career included \"Valentine's Day\" and \"Across the Border\" for only the second time this tour (this time on pump organ). He was in a joking mood, making reference to the Minnesota Vikings \"Love Boat\" scandal that was in the news at the time. He also apologised for taking so long to play Madison again, promising to come back with the E Street Band. The mighty talents of SDonkey and Cheesesteak Productions have joined forces to present the show on \"Madison, That's Where the Fun Is\". The main feature consists of a two cam mix taken from videos shot by Fig and SDonkey from similar positions on each side of the arena. Both sources are handheld, so the constant camera movement is inevitable. However, it is more stable than most handheld footage and both filmers do a good job of maintaining a central and unobstructed view of Bruce (albeit a little distant). The real revelation though, is the image quality of the right-side source. It is pin-point sharp and the dark tones are completely free of the low level digital noise that plagues almost every other video from the tour. Yes, black is actually black! The left hand view is softer and grainier, but still compliments the dominant angle nicely. The accurately dubbed audio has been remastered by Rockaway Rob to bring out the optimum sound quality with tremendously clear results. The set also includes a photomontage title sequence showing the venue and a credit sequence which includes a tongue-in-cheek memorial to a comrade who is no longer with us. It is topped off with a steady, full-frame, high quality screen shot and of \"Stolen Car\" from the Cleveland show earlier in the year. The complimentary angles, excellent image quality of the primary source, great dubbed audio and overall excellent production values makes \"Madison, That's Where the Fun Is\" a contender for the best DVD set of the tour. If you are the kind of collector that is only interested in a couple of DVDs from each tour, then this one should definitely be on your list.",

        "description": "When Bruce and the E Street Band reunited in 1995 to go back in the recording studio and shoot a promo video for the \"Greatest Hits\" album, film maker Ernie Fritz was there to capture the event for posterity. Some of his film was seen in the 80 minute documentary \"Blood Brothers\", but raw footage of the \"Murder Incorporated\" promo shoot at Tramps in New York has finally escaped the clutches of the ubertraders and made its way into general circulation. It has been released on DVD \"silvers\" under the title \"Behind the Blood Brothers\". The two DVD set combines Fritz's candid backstage footage with outtakes from Jonathan Demme's promo shoot to provide complete coverage of the day at Tramps. We get to see the band's on-stage afternoon rehearsals, backstage acoustic rehearsals, makeup sessions, chats with fans inside and outside the club and even Clarence doing the Striptease in his dressing room! Several run-throughs of \"Murder Incorporated\" for the promo video are included, together with parts of the concert that followed. There are also scenes of the backstage self-congratulation after the show and an interview with Demme. Finally, there are some transitional shots of the Tramps sign and the view out of an aircraft window. The set contains some wonderful moments, ranging from the intimate backstage renditions of songs like \"You Can Look...\", Bruce talking to a fan about his guitar with great pride, through to the spirited show finale of \"Little Latin Lupe Loop\". However, it should be understood that this is a copy of the unedited raw film and has been assembled in an extremely rough fashion. It consists of a series of relatively short single camera clips, ranging from just a few seconds to a couple of minutes in length. Consequently, virtually all of the performances are incomplete. There are lots of technical problems throughout, including tape speedup, freeze frames, blank screens and audio drop-out. Thankfully though, these glitches are largely confined to the beginning or end of the various clips. The audio is also very uneven, with Bruce's vocal often back in the mix. Despite the problems, this is clearly a very low generation source and so the picture quality is extremely good. The DVDs have been created using a standalone recorder and so there is no authoring or indexing. Disc 1 of the version shown here has also been duplicated a second time on a standalone recorder, resulting in double menus, a loss of picture quality and a minor offset in the audio/video sync. Disc 2 has been padded out with the TV broadcast version of the April '95 Sony Studios show in excellent quality. \"Behind the Blood Brothers\" (a.k.a. \"Tramps '95\") offers a fascinating glimpse of a landmark event in Bruce's career. It forms an essential part of any self-respecting Springsteen DVD collection.",

It is an excellent quality capture of a 4:3 digital TV broadcast, but is as \"bare bones\" as you can possibly get. There is not even a menu, let alone Bruce's jam on \"In the Midnight Hour\" from later in the ceremony. It's very nice as far as it goes, but a 16:9 version with the second performance would have been even better.",

        "description": "This ancient handheld camcorder video of Bruce and the Band on the European leg of \"The River\" tour has been in circulation in various high gen versions for many years. However, it can now be seen in much improved quality via this new DVD that uses a VHS tape dubbed directly from the master as its source. The video is shot from the right side of the arena, with stage equipment partially obstructing the view. There is also a strange smearing effect across the image. The audio is dull and distant. It is undoubtedly much better than all the versions that have gone before, but is still very poor by today's standards. The incomplete clips of 10 songs from the show have been transferred as two separate Titles, running for a total of 26 minutes. Whether you view this is a priceless treasure, an interesting curio or just plain unwatchable depends very much on how you feel about the rare opportunity to see Bruce arguably in his prime.",

        "description": "Five years earlier on the Reunion tour, Atlanta fans were lucky enough to enjoy two world premier performances, namely \"Further On (Up the Road)\" and \"American Skin (41 Shots)\". There weren't any new songs when the \"Devils & Dust\" tour rolled into town, but Atlanta was still blessed with (to quote Bruce) a \"back-to-back, never-played-before double header\". \"Sad Eyes\" saw the light of day for the first time since its appearance on \"Tracks\" in 1998 and then came the big one - the first ever live performance of \"Valentine's Day\" from \"Tunnel of Love\". It was an extra special moment because \"Valentine's Day\" was the only song from a regular studio album to have never been played to a paying audience. The other notable highlight was the rarely performed \"Nothing Man\", dedicated to \"The Rising\" producer and local resident Brendan O'Brien. The video of the first three songs on this simplistically authored DVD is disastrous. The filmer seems to have the camcorder on a low quality setting, resulting in poor resolution and a frame rate akin to a 1920's silent movie. The view from the right side of the stage is also very shaky. Fortunately, the filmer skips \"Lonesome Day\" in order to change both position and camera settings. Things are much better when the video resumes from a slightly more central angle, but definition and steadiness still leave a lot to be desired. The camera motions seems to decrease as the show progresses, so by the time we get to \"Sad Eyes/Valentine's Day\" it is actually pretty watchable. The camcorder audio is surprisingly good throughout. Most viewers will probably switch off after making it far as the premiers and fails to notice the end of the main set and the encores are missing entirely. The menu seems to be a template from a PC authoring package, but virtually no effort has been made to customise it. There are also no Chapter stops whatsoever, making it hard to jump ahead to the interesting bits. Atlanta '05 was a milestone show on the \"Devils & Dust\" tour and deserves a quality outing on DVD. Sadly, this is not it. Die-hards may still want to pick it up for the debut of \"Valentine's Day\".",

        "description": "The German TV news report contained on this DVD documents Bruce's appearance in Bremen on the European leg of the Tunnel of Love tour. It covers the band's arrival by plane, roadies setting up the stage and the gathering crowd. There is a short interview with Clarence Clemons, but his voice is covered by the German-language narration. The real items of interest are the incomplete clips of \"Tunnel of Love\" and \"Boom Boom\" from the show itself. The duration of the report is 16 minutes, but the on-stage footage only lasts around 3 minutes. The source appears to be a 3rd or 4th generation VHS recording of the broadcast, but the image is still reasonably clean. The disc also contains a well executed slide-show of professional-looking stills. Pro-shot footage is always a welcome addition to any collection, but you may want to wait for these clips to appear in a compilation rather than seeking out this dedicated disc. NB: The disc plays without sound on some standalone players due to compatibility issues with the audio format.",

        "description": "After a remarkable seven months, the \"Devils & Dust\" tour staged its finale in Bruce's home State of New Jersey. Donna Summer's \"Last Dance\" was the appropriate choice of P.A. music as the lights went down in Trenton. The show was surprisingly similar to the previous night, including the instrumental opener \"Rumble\" as a tribute to the recently deceased Link Wray. The new arrangements of \"Saint in the City\" and \"Song for Orphans\" also returned, but Bruce couldn't let the event pass without four tour premieres. The biggest surprise was the first outing for \"Zero and Blind Terry\" in over thirty years. \"Fire\" got the bullet mic treatment as another nod to Wray (who covered the song in '78) and Patti came out for a duet on \"Mansion on the Hill\". The fourth tour premiere was a family affair, with a total of 16 friends and relatives (including Bruce's 3 children) joining him on stage for a slightly early \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\". All that was left was a series of thanks and name checks before \"Dream, Baby, Dream\" for one last time. \"You'll Catch Zero and Terry in Trenton\" from Black Lab Productions uses a handheld camcorder video shot from the back of the theatre. The filmer often zooms out between songs and the view gets very shaky until he homes in on his subject again. Once Bruce is centre-frame, things are much more stable. The view feels a little distant and there is the occasional partial obstruction from an audience member's head. Picture quality is very good, particularly during the more brightly lit portions of the show. An excellent audience tape from 'JB' is used for the audio source, but the sync is a little adrift at times. \"You'll Catch Zero and Terry in Trenton\" falls somewhere in the middle of the field of \"Devils & Dust\" shows in terms of technical quality, but it is essential as a representation of a landmark performance.",

Once again, Bruce was up at the crack of dawn to perform from the Convention Hall in Asbury Park on the release date itself, while a taped interview was screened the day before. The DVD opens with the interview, but then cuts to the next day with an interminable series of links included by virtue of the fact that the presenter is standing on the boardwalk surrounded by fans. Amongst the seemingly endless weather reports, there is a brief clip of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\". We then finally get to see \"Jacob's Ladder\" and \"O Mary Don't You Weep\" in full. The source for this transfer appears to be a VHS tape of an analogue broadcast and there are some faint lines of interference rolling diagonally across the screen throughout. Nevertheless, it is still of a more than acceptable quality. \"Live on Good Morning America\" will doubtless be superseded by a better quality version (16:9 HD source, anyone?) at a later date, but it was a welcome opportunity to catch the new band just hours after their TV debut.",

The three songs here represent the performances that were webcast live by MSN. The .wmv webcast stream was captured in .avi format and re-encoded again for DVD. It is therefore unsurprising that resulting video suffers heavily from the multiple compressions. The frame rate is very low and the picture is blocky. The soundboard audio also leaves a lot to be desired. There are no menus or chapter stops. This is a crude attempt to create a DVD from the webcast, but it is still eminently watchable and will suffice until a more careful conversion emerges.",

        "description": "\"Bruce Springsteen: The Seeger Sessions\" is a slightly extended version of the documentary film that was included on the DVD side of \"We Shall Overcome\". The band can be seen recording tracks in Bruce's home studio and chatting about the origins and meaning of the music. It ran on US cable channel CMT during the month following the album's release. There is about 10 minutes of extra footage, notabley a now complete take of \"Erie Canal\" and a previously unseen \"Jacob's Ladder\". There is also some additional banter with the band and Bruce can be seen listening to a playback of \"Froggie Went a Courtin\". The source of the DVD appears to be a digital broadcast, so picture quality is very good. However, a relatively low bitrate has been used (leaving half the disc empty) and so there is still plenty of room for improvement. The disc has been authored with a nice main menu, but no song selection menu. Most collectors will want to track this one down, but the superior picture and sound on the official release will probably outweigh the extra footage found here when it comes to repeat viewings.",

The lengthy chat covers the musical and political landscape in which the new album is set. The discussion is interspersed with several clips from the show itself that appear to be taken directly from the arena video screen feed. We get to see parts of \"John Henry\", \"O Mary Don't You Weep\", \"Pay Me My Money Down\" and \"We Shall Overcome\". Unsurprisingly, the contrast is poor and the image is grainy. Still, this is much better quality than other Springsteen webcasts (Kerry Rally, Jazzfest) that have been converted to DVD in the past. It is well worth getting hold of a copy.",

        "description": "After just four dates on the Seeger Sessions tour, Bruce brought his largest ever band to one of the smallest venues he's ever played for a very special show for the BBC. The concert in St Luke's (a converted church and home of the London Symphony Orchestra) was later broadcast on both radio and TV. Bruce showcased seven tracks from the new album, plus the new \"Poor Man..\" centrepiece. It is beautifully filmed and a joyously exuberant performance. There were at least four different DVD transfers of the TV special circulating on the internet within hours of the screening. However, the davechapman version was unique among these because it was sourced direct from a DAB (Digital Video Broadcasting) signal. This made it possible to author the disc using the MPEG-2 video stream without any further compression or re-encoding. The result is sound and picture digitally identical to the original. The disc is presented in glorious 16:9 anamorphic widescreen. It has no menu at all, but there are chapter stops at the start of each song. More slickly packaged versions will inevitably follow, but this is as good as it can possibly get from a pure audiovisual perspective. The term \"essential\" can be over used, but this one is simply essential.",

        "description": "The night after Bruce reawoke ghosts in Hammersmith, he played a special show for the BBC at St Lukes Church in London. To be broadcast a few days later on both the radio and television, the band played for around 90 minutes with a couple of songs repeated. The full unedited version has yet to appear but this DVD captures the 60 minute broadcast in perfect quality.  \r\nWith only 300 people in attendance, the setlist contains most of the standards from We Shall Overcome: the Seeger Sessions. The broadcast captures the mood perfectly and includes what might normally be considered outtakes, such as the false start to Jacob’s Ladder and Bruce’s disbelief before Mrs McGrath that they left the organ behind. And Blind Alfred Read’s one fan makes an appearance too!  \r\nThe DVD utilizes two sources to gain the best possible quality: the m2v video file from the DVB capture and PCM audio from HOJO’s own XP recording. Also included is the original MPEG-1 audio from the original DVB capture as well as a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound Mix. Definitive!",

        "description": "Bruce's visits to Milan have built a reputation for exceptional shows and the Seeger Sessions Band appearance was no exception. Bruce had great fun with the crowd interaction. He even had to halt sing-alongs to be able to start the next song, but it was all in good spirits. There was some set list shuffling at the start of the show, moving \"Jesse James\" to the opener. However, the biggest surprise came when Bruce debuted the 'Texicali' arrangement of \"Ramrod\" in the encores. The show also continued beyond \"Saints...\" for the first time, with \"Buffalo Gals\" being used as the new closer. The video featured in this DVD was filmed by 'Bruga' from a tripod at the rear of the arena, giving a fairly distant view. Apart from some ragged pans, the picture is very steady. The image quality is amazingly clean and sharp, although slight overexposure means that Bruce's face is whited-out when he is in the spotlight. The camcorder audio is a little muffled, but more than good enough. The discs have been authored by 'Luke' with a simple song-selection menu (note, Dan Tucker and\r\nCadillac Ranch are transposed on the Disc 1 menu). Although \"Milano 2006\" was one of the first DVDs to emerge from the Seeger Session Tour, the steady camerawork and sharp image mean that it will stand up well against other releases.",

        "description": "Two things are guaranteed whenever Bruce hits the stage in Milan: an outstanding performance and a multi-cam DVD!  2006 was no exception with FedeUD producing a 6 camera-mix, perfectly dubbed with astounding sound from Crystal Cat, that should find a place in every collection. With cameras located around the arena, including the pit, and fleeting proshot clips from Italian TV also included in the mix, this DVD has a rare feel of “being there”. The camera work is very steady, mostly filmed from tripods, and the editing ensures there is rarely a bad shot. Overall, the production is very good, with menus and motion menus being used to good effect. However, it is worth noting that a mistake on Disc 1’s menu means Old Dan Tucker links to Cadillac Ranch and vice versa. Purists may also fail to appreciate the song titles appearing on the screen ahead of each song.\r\n \r\nAs for the performance, the setlist is fairly representative of the first European tour, although this is the first time that “Saints” did not close the show and Ramrod makes its tour debut. As ever in Italy, it’s the passionate audience that adds an extra dimension to the show with Bruce almost finding himself accompanying them!\r\n \r\nThis is a wonderful document of the first leg of the tour with the Seeger Sessions Band and will comfortably stand the test of time as one of the very best audience-shot DVDs of this, or any other, tour.\r\n",

        "description": "Amsterdam was mid-way through the first leg of the Seeger Sessions Tour and Bruce stuck to the tried and trusted set list. The only variation was just the second outing for \"Long Black Veil\". This incomplete video of the show was filmed by 'Willem' with a handheld camcorder from a central location in the hall. The majority of the footage features the stage, but there are several switches to the screen. It starts out very shakily, but becomes steadier after the first couple of songs. The picture is very clean and reasonably sharp, but there is some slight pixilation and temporary loss of focus when the filmer uses full zoom. It is presented in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen, which does great justice to the large band. The camcorder audio is a little thin and distant. The disc has been authored by 'It's Boss Time' with an odd opening sequence, but no menu. There are also no chapter stops whatsoever, so you will have difficulty if you want to skip straight to \"Long Black Veil\". The widescreen view is nice, but the lack of proper authoring will prevent this from getting many repeat trips back to your DVD player.",

        "description": "During the North American leg of the Seeger Sessions Tour, Bruce embraced technology and provided a video stream on AOL after 18 of the shows. AOL Sessions uses these videos, downloaded at 700K and converted to NTSC (MPEG-2 720x480 29,97fps VBR 8000kbps, Linear PCM 48000Hz 1536kbps), with excellent results. \r\nWhile the performances, video and audio are all top notch, the production doesn’t quite meet the same standards. Volume 1 is split into separate titles and makes it impossible to move between tracks without returning to the menu. This problem isn’t apparent on Volume 2 but the Conan O’Brien footage hasn’t been chaptered so, again, it is not possible to move easily between tracks.  \r\nThe bonus footage on Volume 2 differentiates the collection from other similar AOL collections but probably isn’t enough to override the production errors and make this the set to seek out.\r\n",

        "description": "With Patti not in attendance, the Seeger Sessions Band were one red-headed woman down but the performance didn’t suffer. An appropriately “loose” show for Milwaukee saw Bruce’s guitar fail during Jesse James and a polka version of Ramrod during the encore. Only the second Further On (Up the Road) with the Seeger Sessions Band featured the tremendous voices of all the vocalists too. And no show in Milwaukee would be complete without a drive through the Wisconsin night in the funky arrangement of Cadillac Ranch! \r\nThe DVD production is tremendously slick, with a nice introduction and a slideshow filling in a gap during Old Dan Tucker. The video is nicely shot from a single camera high above the stage on the left hand side of the arena. On occasion, some of the camera work is a little unsteady and the zoom is used a little too enthusiastically but these are minor quibbles and inevitable whenever a single camera is trying to capture so much action on stage. For reference, and kudos, the show was filmed by JTT; the audio mixed and remastered by NEO; it was digitally mastered and authored by Fig; artwork was designed by GChord; Executive Producer credits go to Joan Fontaine; and SDonkey obtained the master tapes. An all-star cast! \r\nThis is definitely a worthy addition to any collection but shouldn’t be considered a must-have. \r\n",

        "description": "Love it or loathe it, the Devils and Dust tour was interesting, to say the least. On more than one occassion, Bruce surprised the audience with stand out performances of songs that many figured were either forgotten, or that the man himself would never play live. Once the tour was over, a look back provided an education how Bruce supplied a healthy dose of \"nuggets\" for the long time fans. \r\n\r\nThe Devils And Dust: Rarities Collection, which spans 4 discs (including the later added \"Europe\" disc), is a comprehensive document to these nuggets. A very ambitious project technically, as well as artistically, and Brucevideos pulls it off in style. Much like the famed \"Flynn Audio Compilations\" that are much sought after at the end of any tour, Brucevideos has started (?) a video representation that could well be regarded as highly as Flynn's one day - we will have to wait and see.\r\n\r\nFrom the opening performance on disc one with \"Rumble\", to the closing of the set with \"Maria's Bed\", the collection offers a variety of rarely performed songs from the Devils and Dust Tour. All songs have been beautifully mixed one in to the other, so as to give the sense that the entire collection is like \"one big long concert\". However, each song stands on its own when viewed at random as well. The video sources, while being from a wide variety of already circulating material (none of it proshot), in most cases has not been altered from the original - and unfortunately this collection suffers slightly due to this.  The mood gets broken every so often when the viewer watches one clip in stellar quality, only to have the next one be in a lesser quality. A very minor thing, but noticable.\r\n\r\nThe audio is what really shines through. The mix of the audio is such that each clip is almost seemlesly intigrated with the next, as if that were the way they were originally produced. The sound is even throughout, and it is evident that a great deal of care went into the audio dub of this collection. No easy task considering the vast variety of source material.\r\n\r\nDevils And Dust: Rarities Collection, is a \"must have\". With all the standout performances, and \"live debuts\" contained, it would be hard to pass this one by. With the added high production values of Brucevideos, it is even more of one that belongs in every fan's collection.\r\n\r\n[Edit: The \"Europe\" disc is in the PAL format]",

        "description": "After a 3 month break, Bologna witnessed the first night of the second European tour of 2006. With “The River” and “This Little Light of Mine” appearing in the set for the first time, this hinted at things to come over the next two months; tour debuts almost became the norm, with Bruce reaching into his back catalogue and reinvigorating some old classics in new musical arrangements.  \r\nFedeUD has added to his reputation for producing multi-cam DVDs with this 5 cam effort. The remixed audio is good and the motion menus are nicely done. However, unlike the earlier outstanding 6 cam mix of the show in Milan during May, this production is marred by some shaky camera work, particularly the screenshots, and some bizarre editing choices. A tremendous amount of work has clearly gone into this: the video switches between cameras every few seconds but this means perfectly clear and steady shots are too often sacrificed for obstructed or shaky shots. FedeUD has perhaps been too keen to utilize all the cameras when a better experience might have been obtained by placing more emphasis on longer edits from a couple of the cameras. \r\nThere is no doubting the effort put into this and, all in all, this is a good production However, it could have been even better- less would definitely have been more!\r\n",

        "description": "As the Rising Tour drew to a close in New York, this 30 minute DVD captures Bruce and the E-Street Band working hard before the shows to rehearse songs, some that would become tour debuts. Bruce is in playful mood, dancing with Patti during “Man’s Job”, and if you thought that speech before “Back In Your Arms Again” during the final show of the tour was improvised… you’d be wrong! Reports suggest \"New York City Serenade\" and \"If I should Fall Behind\" formed part of the soundcheck on the first night, and that \"I Wish I were Blind\" was played during the final soundcheck: if true, none of these have been captured here. \r\nThe DVD looks to be shot from halfway back: to the left of the stage on 1 October and the right of the stage on 4 October. Mostly stageshot, with the odd screenshot, it is mostly centred on Bruce but captures other band members as he moves around the stage. The audio is also very clear and the production is good, although the menus make a couple of errors: they make reference to 2004 and the second\"Johnny 99\" is taken from the final night rather than the penultimate night. \r\nAnother release in TattooDad’s quest for uber material, this DVD is very welcome and a good insight into the preparation that goes into shows. Practice, practice, practice! \r\n",

        "description": "This DVD starts out with the audio only from Red Headed Woman. The filmer then takes quite awhile to get a steady shot (somewhere around Trapped). Get ready for plenty of shots of the speaker system. Aside from the struggles early to get a clean shot, it also suffers from many generational loss issues included unbalanced colors, blurred image and tracking problems. \r\nEven the solid audio is betrayed by the higher generation copy with a high level of tape hiss. There isn’t much in the way of cuts except for Cover Me, which isn’t complete on either disc. There’s no real reason to hunt this one down until someone does a better transfer with a lower generation tape. \r\n",

We must also thank the source for his generosity, and Digi-TOx for his efforts in authoring this masterpiece.\r\n\r\nTruly, this represents \"MUST HAVE\" more than any other Bruce release to date.

The footage collected here is in great quality, although many of the songs are either cut, or marred with timecode stamps (or that annoying 'blue diamond'). The audio is line fed and is excellent. The dates and locations are the best guesses possible. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe interesting thing about this release, is how it was released. With no menus to speak of, and little fanfare, the DVD was made available by Brucevideos (but does not contain the trademark quality of their past releases). 'Half-Assed' would be the term to use here. But still, a very nice addition for those that want to recall Bruce at the height of his popularity as a cultural icon. \r\n",

        "description": "An excellent compilation of various sourced proshot video of Bruce early in his career. The entire set was obviously crafted with care by HOJO Productions as the video presented is excellent (considering the age of most of this footage). The entire 2 disc set is presented as a dedicated effort to the memory of much missed former SPL member, \"july14th,1985\", who had passed away. A fitting tribute. There are some minor flaws however, here and there, but considering the historical significance of this footage, not a major concern. Fans of the 70s era will no doubt want to seek this one out. Fans new to Bruce should also seek it out as it serves as a great document on what made Bruce one of the greatest live performers ever. ",

Evidence of this, of coarse, is what this DVD shines with. While the frequent obstruction of people's heads and whatnot, get in the way of a good view, as well as the camera shake that follows, it somehow adds to the feeling that you are at the show. Even though the video does suffer from this quite a bit, the audio used for dubbing makes up for most it. All together, a very enjoyable DVD to experience. Another fine hand-held release. ",

        "description": "Yet another review of an AOL compilation... A nicely put together set of Bruce's entire AOL webcast videos. The clips have been seemlessly linked, and produce a nice 'flow' to whole set. The menu is a nice motion type, with audio. Where this set suffers, however, is in the encoding of the video and audio. Right from the start of the first video, it is apparent that 'heavy filtering' was used in the process. The video look murky and the audio sounds muddy. According to the release notes, additional compression was used for the audio (AC3) and, unfortunatly you can hear the difference. Its too bad, as overall, the compilation was nicely put together. ",

        "description": "The first, of what turned out to be many, compilation of Bruce's webcasts on AOL, \"The Story So Far...\" was released as 'teaser' of sorts when it came out. With only seven of the broadcast videos represented (plus a bonus video of Bruce on Jay Leno), brucevideos was so excited by the event that they released it anyway. An excellent compilation quality-wise, as the video and audio are stellar considering the source material. And the menu, using the AOL announcement page, was a nice touch. Still, it is incomplete, and that is really a shame. Brucevideos indicated that a 'follow up' version, or complete version would follow, but it never was to be. With a release like this, the probable outcome would have most likely been one of the best collections. However, there are lots to choose from now. This DVD is a nice momento, but not a must have or anything. You can do better obtaining one of the complete sets out there instead. ",

        "description": "When Bruce and the Seeger Sessions Band returned to Europe in October 2006, the third leg of the tour kicked off with a 7 night stand in Italy. 7 nights to folk! And swing! This DVD compilation captures portions of each night and shows a band in typically boisterous form, if not quite hitting the heights seen a month or so later. \r\n\r\nThis 3 DVD set, which runs for approximately 228 minutes, has a number of pleasing technical features: its been digitally mastered; has PCM stereo; has interactive menus; and is available in 16:9 widescreen. The audio is mostly very good, particularly on the first two DVDs. All shows are captured from steady single cameras and, despite some being positioned on the floor of the arena, all produce largely unobstructed shots of the stage. Occasionally, the camera pans away to capture the audience and this produces a good sense of the infamous Italian atmosphere. \r\n\r\nThe fact that this is a compilation of several nights and as a set it doesn't quite flow (admittedly this is a criticism that some official releases- Live in New York City and Live in Dublin- have also suffered!) and some songs are unecessarily repeated. But these are minor criticisms- this is certainly an excellent production and a good reference for anyone who didn't catch the final stretch in Europe . ",
